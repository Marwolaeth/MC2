The word \"system\" is familiar in everyday speech and is used to describe all manner of things: means of communication, ecology, politics, the workings of the market, etc. A \"system\" involves a group of related components that operates as a whole. For instance, the digestive system consists of body organs and reflexes that, collectively, transform food into the elementary substances needed for metabolism. In the economic theory of the market, components are prices, demand, and supply. These three components are not independent. Demand is related to price as is supply, both are what economists sometimes call \"curves\" but which we would call functions.\n\nKey steps in making a mathematical representation---a model---of a system involve identifying the system components and describing quantitatively the relationships among them. In brief, mathematical modeling is about describing the ***relationships*** between things.\n\n\n::: {.practice data-latex=\"\"}\nLet's start with a simple system that is so familiar that you likely do not think of it as a system: a triangle.\n\nA triangle consists of three connected line segments: the sides. It has other properties that are related to the sides and each other, for example, the angles between sides, the perimeter, or the area enclosed by the triangle. \n\nHere's a description of the relationship between the perimeter $p$ and the lengths of the sides, $a$, $b$, $c$, written in the form of a function:\n$$p(a,b,c) \\equiv a + b + c\\ .$$\nThe mathematical expression of the relationship between area $A$ enclosed by the triangle and the side lengths goes back at least 2000 years to [Heron of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) (circa 10â€“70). As a function, it can be written\n$$A(a,b,c) \\equiv \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\strut 4a^2b^2-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2}\\ .$$\n:::\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-carbon-phases\n#| fig-cap: \"Phase diagram for CO_2_.

It's hard to store gasses in the massive quantities needed to mitigate climate change. But CO_2_ storage is part of a system that includes temperature, pressure, and chemical affinity. \n\n@fig-carbon-phases shows the relationship between physical form of pure CO_2_ and the temperature and pressure of the gas. \n:::\n\n::: {.intheworld data-latex=\"\"}\nNerve cells communicate via electrical voltages and currents. For long-distance communications (distances longer than about 1 mm) the signaling takes the form of pulses of voltage occuring repetitively at different rates. The formation of these pulses, called \"action potentials,\" was the subject of an extensive research project in the 1950s involving inserting tiny electrodes into relatively large (\"giant\") nerve cells that mediate the fleeing reaction of squid. A typical experiment involved regulating artificially the voltage across the cell membrane. By these experiments, the scientists--- John Eccles, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley---were able to describe mathematically the relationship between membrane voltage and the current across the membrane. A calculus model built from the relationships provided a concise description of the biophysics of action potentials. A 1963 Nobel Prize was awarded for this work.\n\n\nIn each individual experimental run, the membrane voltage was fixed at a given level (say, -50 mV) and the current measured. Figure @fig-fhn-model shows what the data might have looked like, each point showing the results of one experimental run.\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-fhn-model\n#| fig.cap: \"Data (simulated) from the squid giant axon experiments. A smooth curve is drawn through the data points.\"\n#| cap-location: margin\n\nset.seed(101)\nn <- 30\nFHN_points <- tibble(\n  v = sample(c(-2, -1.5, -1, -.5, 0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2), n, replace=TRUE),\n  w = v - v^3/3\n) %>% \n  mutate(v=(1.9+v+rnorm(n, 0, 0.01))/36,\n         w=w+rnorm(n, 0, 0.1))\ngf_point(w ~ I(-v*36*25), data = FHN_points) %>%\n  gf_labs(y=\"Current (mA)\", x = \"Voltage (mV)\") %>%\n  slice_plot( -(v/25 + 2) + (v/25 + 2)^3/3 ~ v, \n              domain(v=-105:5)) +\n  coord_flip()\n```\nThe data points themselves might be described metaphorically as \"clouds\" spotting the voltage vs current \"sky.\" Real-world clouds often show patterns such as animal or country shapes. We might say that a given cloud resembles a rabbit. Similarly, the data clouds show a pattern between current and voltage. We might, for instance, describe the current-voltage relationship as S-shaped. Or, rather than using the letter \"S\" we could draw a curve through the dots to summarize and simplify the relationship.\n:::\n\nThe smooth curve in  @fig-fhn-model describes the relationship between current and voltage quantitatively. For example, if you know that the current is 0, you can use the curve to figure out what the voltage will be around -90 mV or  -50 mV or -10 mV. But when current is 0, the voltage will *not* be, say, -75 or -150.\n\nGraphs such as  @fig-carbon-phases and @fig-fhn-model are good ways of showing relationships. We can even do calculations simply using such graphs. Place your finger on a point of the S-shaped graph and you can read from the axes an allowed pair of voltage and current values. Place your finger on a point on the vertical axis. Moving it to the curve will reveal what current is associated with that voltage.\n\nFunctions are, like graphs, a ways of representing relationships. For all their advantages as a means of communication, graphs have their limits. With a graph it's feasible only to show the relationship between two quantities or among three quantities. Functions, can involve more quantities. For instance, the triangle-area function $$A(a,b,c) \\equiv \\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\strut 4a^2b^2-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2}$$ gives the relationship between four quantities: the area and the lengths of the triangle's three sides.\n\nOn the other hand, functions cannot represent all types of relationships. For instance, the curve in @fig-fhn-model shows a relationship between current and voltage in nerve cells. But there is no mathematical function voltage(current) that does justice to the relationship. The reason is that mathematical functions can have ***one and only one*** output for any given input. There are three reasonable values for membrane voltage that are experimentally consistent with a zero current, not just one.\n\nCare needs to be taken in using functions to represent relationships. For the nerve-cell current-voltage relationship, for instance, we can construct a function current(voltage) to represent the relationship. That's because for any given value of voltage there is just one corresponding current. But there is no voltage(current) function, even though knowing the current tells you a lot about the voltage.\n\n## Function graphs\n\nGiven a function, it's easy to draw the corresponding relationship as a graphic. This section describes how to do that for functions that have one or two inputs. The opposite---given a relationship, represent it using functions---is not always so easy and will require modeling techniques that we'll develop in Block 1.\n\nContemporary practice is to draw graphs of functions using a computer. R/mosaic provides several functions that do this, you need only learn how to use them.\n\nThere are two essential arguments shared by all of the R/mosaic functions drawing a graph:\n\n1. The function that is to be graphed. This is to be written as a ***tilde expression*** in exactly the same manner as described in Chapter @notation-and-computing.\n2. The ***domain interval***. The domain of many functions reaches to infinity, but our computer screens are not so big! Making a graph requires choosing a finite interval for each of the input variables. \n\nThe tilde expression for a function with one input will have only one name on the right-hand side of the <span style=\"font-size:250%'\">~</span>. The domain interval specification must use the same name:\n\nTilde expression     |  Domain interval specification\n---------------------|----------------------------\n`x^2 ~ x`            |  `interval(x = -3:3)`\n`y * exp(y) ~ y`     |  `interval(y = 0:10)`\n`log(y) / exp(y) ~ y`|  `interval(y = -5:5)`\n`sin(z) / z ~ z`     |  `interval(y = -3*pi:3*pi)`\n\n### Slice plot\n\nTo draw a graph of a function with one input, use `slice_plot()`. The tilde expression is the first argument; the domain interval specification is the second argument. For instance,\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-first-slice-plot\n#| fig.cap: \"Graph of the function $f(y) \\\\equiv y e^y$.\"\n#| cap-location: margin\nslice_plot(y * exp(y) ~ y, domain(y=0:10))\n```\n\n[The ***graphics frame*** in @fig-first-slice-plot is a 2-dimensional area for drawing. The ***domain*** of the function being graphed in that frame, $f() \\equiv y e^y$, is the number line, that is, the space of all real numbers. The plot, however, shows only a finite interval $0 \\leq y \\leq 10$ of that domain.]{.aside}\n\nRecall the situation seen in @fig-fhn-model which shows a two-dimensional space of all possible (voltage, current) pairs for nerve cells. The experimental data identified many possible pairs---marked by the dots in Figure @fig-fhn-model ---that are consistent with the relationships of the nerve-cell system.\n\nThe same is true of @fig-first-slice-plot, the graph of a function with a single input. The two-dimensional space shown in the @fig-first-slice-plot contains (input, output) pairs, only a small fraction of which are consistent with the relationship described by the function. The points in that small fraction could be marked by individual dots, but instead of dots we draw  the continuous curve connecting the dots. Every point on the curve is consistent with the relationship between input and output represented by the function. \n\n\n### Contour plot\n\nFunctions with **two inputs** can be displayed with `contour_plot()`. Naturally, the tilde expression defining the function will have **two** names on the right-hand side of <span style=\"font-size:250%'\">~</span>. Similarly, the domain specification will have two arguments, one for each of the names in the tilde expression.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-first-contour\n#| fig-cap: \"Contour plot of a function with two inputs $g(y,z) \\\\equiv e^{-z}\\\\sin(y)$\"\n#| fig-cap-location: margin\ncontour_plot(exp(-z)*sin(y) ~ y & z, domain(y=-6:6, z=0:2))\n```\n\nContour plots will be a preferred format for displaying functions with two inputs. The main reason to prefer contour plots is the ease with which locations of points in the input space can be identified and the ability to read output values without much difficulty. \n\n### Surface plot\n\nThere's another way to think about graphing functions with two inputs. There are in such a situation **three** quantities involved in the relationship. Two of these are the inputs, the third is the output. A three-dimensional space consists of all the possible triples of point; the relationship between the inputs and the output is marked by ruling out almost all of the potential triples and marking those points in the space that are consistent with the function.\n\nthe space of all possibilities (y, z, output) is three-dimensional, but very few of those possibilities are consistent with the function to be graphed. You can imagine our putting dots at all of those consistent-with-the-function points, or our drawing lots and lots of continuous curves through those dots, but really the cloud of dots forms a ***surface***; a continuous cloud of points floating over the (y, z) input space.\n\n@fig-first-surface displays this surface. Since the image is drawn on a two-dimensional screen, we have to use painters' techniques of perspective and shading. In the interactive version of the plot, you can move the viewpoint for the image which gives many people a more solid understanding of the surface being shown.\n\n\n```{r results=\"hide\", eval=FALSE}\n  surface_plot(exp(-z)*sin(y) ~ y & z, interval(y=-6:6, z=0:2))\n```\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-first-surface\n#| fig-cap: \"Displaying $g(y,z) \\\\equiv e^{-z}\\\\sin(y)$ as a surface plot annotated with contour lines.\"\nif (!knitr::is_html_output()) {\n  knitr::include_graphics(\"www/surface-plot1.png\")\n} else {\n  surface_plot(exp(-z)*sin(y) ~ y & z, interval(y=-6:6, z=0:2))\n}\n```\n\nNote that the surface plot is made with the R/mosaic `surface_plot()`, which takes arguments in exactly the same way as `contour_plot()`.\n\n\n\n\n## Interpreting contour plots {#interpreting-contour-plots}\n\n\nIt may take some practice to learn to read contour plots fluently but it is a skill that's worthwhile to have. Note that the graphics frame is the Cartesian space of the two inputs. The output is presented as ***contour lines***. Each contour line has a label giving the numerical value of the function output. Each of the input value pairs on a given contour line corresponds to an output at the level labeling that contour line. To find the output for an input pair that is *not* on a contour line, you ***interpolate*** between the contours on either side of that point.\n\n::: {.practice data-latex=\"\"}\n\nWhat's the value of the function being plotted here at input $(\\text{input}_1=0, \\text{input}_2=0)$?\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nf2 <- rfun( ~ input_1 + input_2, seed=932)\ncontour_plot(f2(input_1, input_2) ~ input_1 + input_2,\n                 domain(input_1=c(-5, 5), input_2 = c(0, 4)),\n             skip=0) %>%\n  gf_labs(x = \"Input 1\", y = \"Input 2\") %>%\n  gf_point(0 ~ 0, color=\"red\", size=1)\n  \n```\n\nThe input pair (0, 0)---which is marked by a small red dot---falls between the contours labeled \"20\" and \"22.\" This means that the output corresponding to input (0, 0) is somewhere between 20 and 22. The point is much closer to the contour labeled \"20\", so it's reasonable to see the output value as 20.5. This is, of course, an approximation, but that's the nature of reading numbers off of graphs.\n:::\n\nOften, the specific numerical value at a point is not of primary interest. Instead, we may be interested in how steep the function is at a point, which is indicated by the spacing between contours. When contours are closely spaced, the hillside is steep. Where contours are far apart, the hillside is not steep, perhaps even flat.\n\nAnother common task for interpreting contour plots is to locate the input pair that's at a local high point or low point: the top of a hill or the bottom of a hollow. Such points are called ***local argmax*** or ***local argmin*** respectively. The *output* of the function at a local argmax is called the ***local maximum***; similarly for a local argmin, where the output is called a ***local minimum***. (The word \"argmax\" is a contraction of \"argument of the maximum.\" We will tend to use the word \"input\" instead of \"argument\", but it means exactly the same thing to say \"the inputs to a function\" as to says \"the arguments of a function.\")\n\n::: {.practice data-latex=\"\"}\nFor this contour graph \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n#| label: dkskes\n#| fig-cap: \"\"\ng <- rfun(~ x & y, seed=783)\ncontour_plot(g(x,y)-2.5 ~ x & y, interval(x=-3:3, y=-3:6), skip=0, label_alpha=.5)\n```\n\ni. Find an input coordinate where the function is steepest.\nii. Find input coordinates for the high and low points in the function .\n\n\n\nA function is steepest where contour lines are spaced closely together, that is, where the function output changes a lot with a small change in input. This is true near inputs $(x=0, y=1)$. But notice that steepness involves a *direction*. Near $(x=0,y=1)$, changing the $x$ value does not lead to a big change in output, but a small change in the value of $y$ leads to a big change in output.  In other words, the function is steep in the y-direction but not in the x-direction.\n\nThe highest output value explicitly marked in the graph is 8. We can imagine from the shapes of the contours surrounding the 8 contour that the function reaches a peak somewhere in the middle of the region enclosed by the 8 contour, near the input coordinate $(x=0, y=-1.5)$.\n\nSimilarly, the lowest output value marked is -10. In the middle of the area enclosed by the -10 contour is a local low point. That there are two such regions, one centered near input coordinate $(x=-0.5, y=3.3)$, the other at $(x=1.5, y=3.1)$.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.why data-latex=\"\"}\nWhy do you call the graphs of functions of one variables **slice plots** rather than simply graphs?\n\nSaying \"graph\" for a display of $f(x)$ versus $x$ is correct and reasonable. But in *MOSAIC Calculus* we have another point to make.\n\nAlmost always, when mathematically modeling a real-world situation or phenomenon, we do not try to capture every nuance of every relationship that might exist in the real world. We leave some things out. Such simplifications make modeling problems easier to deal with and encourage us to identify the most important features of the most important relationships.\n\n[As you become practiced reading contour plots, you might prefer to read this one as a hilltop (shaded yellow) side-by-side with a hollow or bowl (shaded purple), with green, almost level flanks at the left and right edges of the frame.]{.aside}\n\n\n```{r  echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-contour-pre-slice\n#| fig-cap: \"A hypothetical relationship among three quantities.\"\nf2 <- rfun( ~ input_1 + input_2, seed=96)\ncontour_plot(f2(input_1, input_2) ~ input_1 + input_2,\n                 domain(input_1=c(-5, 5), input_2 = c(0, 4)),\n             skip=0)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this spirit, it's useful always to assume that our models are leaving something out and that a more complete model involves a function with more inputs than the present candidate. The present candidate model should be considered as a ***slice*** of a more complete model. Our slice leaves out one or more of the variables in a more complete model.\n\nTo illustrate this, suppose that the actual system involves relationships among three quantitiess, which we represent in the form of a function of two inputs, as shown in @fig-contour-pre-slice. (The third quantity in the relationship is the output of the function.)\n\n\n\nThe most common forms of ***slice*** involve constructing a simpler function that has one input but not the other. For example, our simpler function might ignore input 22. There are different ways of collapsing the function of two inputs into a function of one input. An especially useful way in calculus is to take the two-input function and set one of the inputs to a ***constant value***.\n\nFor instance, suppose we set input 22 to the constant value 1.5. This means that we can consider any value of input 1, but input 2 has been replaced by 1.5. In Figure @fig-contour-slice, we've marked in red the points in the contour plot that give the output of the simplified function. \n\n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-contour-slice\n#| fig-cap: \"Left: A slice (red) through the domain of a contour plot.

From the contours, we can read the output corresponding to each of those values of input #1. This relationship, output versus input #1 can be drawn as a mathematical graph (to the right of the contour plot). Study that graph until you can see how the rising and falling parts of the graph correspond to the contours being crossed by the red line.\n\nSlices can be taken in any direction or even along a curved path!
