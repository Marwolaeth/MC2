They recognized that a traditional calculus introduction is ill-suited to the needs of STEM in the 21st century.\n\nCritical support was given by the [ARDI Foundation](http://ardifoundation.org) which awarded the [Holland H. Coors Chair in Education Technology](http://www.ardifoundation.org/coors-chair/) to one of the project members, Daniel Kaplan. This made possible a year-long residency at USAFA during which time he was able to work unhindered on this project.\n\nMacalester College, where Kaplan is DeWitt Wallace Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer science, was the site where the overall framework and many of the materials for a STEM-oriented calculus were developed. Particularly important in the germination were David Bressoud and Jan Serie, respectively chairs of the Macalester math and biology departments, as well as Prof. Thomas Halverson and Prof. Karen Saxe, who volunteered to team teach with Kaplan the first prototype course. Early grant support from the Howard Hughes Medical Foundation and the Keck Foundation provided the resources to carry the prototype course to a point of development where it became the entryway to calculus for Macalester students.\n\nProfs. Randall Pruim (Calvin University) and Nicholas Horton (Amherst College) were essential collaborators in developing software to support calculus in R. They and Kaplan formed the core team of Project MOSAIC, which was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF DUE-0920350).\n\nJoel Kilty and Alex McAllister at Centre College admired the Macalester course and devoted much work and ingenuity to write a textbook, *Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus* (Oxford Univ. Press), implementing their own version. Their textbook enabled us to reduce the use of sketchy notes in the first offering of this course at USAFA.\n\n\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.\n\n\nPut PDF into Tufte mode.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-marginnn\n#| fig-cap: \"MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\"\n#| column: margin\n#| message: false\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars2 <- mtcars\nmtcars2$am <- factor(\n  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')\n)\nggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n```\n\n\n\n::: {#thm-first}\nThe first theorem is this.\n:::\n\nYou've got to have a `data-latex=\"\"` for the latex environment to be invoked.\n\n::: {.why data-latex=\"\"}\nCalling the booboo environment from a div\n:::\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["mosaic-calc-style.css"],"include-in-header":["mathjax-definitions.html"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":6.5,"fig-height":4.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","include-in-header":["latex-definitions.tex"],"output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt","always_allow_html":true},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
