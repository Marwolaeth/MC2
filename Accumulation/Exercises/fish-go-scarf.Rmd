Here is a graph of four different functions.


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/DD31-four-funs.png"))
```

Regard those four functions as $F_1(x)$ through $F_4(x)$. 

For each of the following plots, the single function graphed has an anti-derivative which is one of $F_1(x)$ through $F_4(x)$. You're job is to say which is which.

```{r fgso-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="Which of the four functions shown in the top graph is an anti-derivative of the function graphed just below?", 
  "+Black/Dotted+",
  "Red/Dashed & Dotted",
  "Blue/Long Dashed",
  "Magenta/Solid",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-dd31-1
#| fig.cap: "Function for question (A)."
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/DD31-four-funs-1.png"))
```

```{r fgso-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="Which of the four functions shown in the top graph is an anti-derivative of the function graphed just below?", 
  "Black/Dotted",
  "+Red/Dashed & Dotted+",
  "Blue/Long Dashed",
  "Magenta/Solid",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-dd31-2
#| fig.cap: "Function for question (B)."
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/DD31-four-funs-2.png"))
