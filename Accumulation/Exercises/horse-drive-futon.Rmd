@fig-solar-june-c3, previously used in Exercises `r ref_ex("KINWgK")` and `r ref_ex("WFYt0W")`,  comes from the monitoring app for a photovoltaic (solar electricity) array on two consecutive days in June 2022. The vertical axis has units of kilowatts and dimension [power] L^2^ M / T^2^.

Electric utilities don't charge for power, they charge for **energy**, dimension L^2^ M / T, which is typically denominated in units of kilowatt-hours. The local utility charges $0.14 per kilowatt-hour. For each of the two days, what was the money value of the energy produced by the solar array. (Your answer can be rough, but aim to be within $\pm$10%.)

- June 3: 
- June 4:

Hint: Find the value for June 4 first. That will make the June 3 estimate easier.
