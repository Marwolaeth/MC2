On the radio, I once heard a baseball fanatic describing the path of a home run slammed just inside the left-field post. "Coming off the bat, the ball screamed upwards, passing five stories over the head of the first baseman and still gaining altitude. Then, somewhere over mid-left-field, gravity caught up with the ball, forcing it down faster and faster until it crashed into the cheap seats." A gripping image, perhaps, but wrong about the physics. Gravity doesn't suddenly catch hold of the ball. Even when upward bound, gravity influences the ball to the same extent as it does at the peak of the flight and as the ball falls back down. The vertical velocity of the ball is positive while climbing and negative on descent, but that velocity is steadily changing all through the flight: a smooth, almost linear numerical decrease in velocity from the time the ball leaves the bat to when it lands in the bleachers.

At each instant of time, the ball's vertical velocity has a numerical value in feet-per-second (L T^-1^). That value changes continuously. If $Z(t)$ is the height of the ball at time $t$, and $v_Z(t)$ is the vertical velocity at time $t$, then the slope function $${\cal D}_t Z(t) \equiv \frac{Z(t+h) - Z(t)}{h}$$ tells us the average velocity of the ball over a time interval of $h$.

The "average velocity" is a human construction because $h$ is a human choice. The reality pointed to by Newton is that at each instant in time the ball has a continuously changing velocity. Velocity is the physical reality: an instantaneous quantity. The "average velocity" is merely a concession to the way we measure the velocity, by recording the height at two different times and computing the difference in height divided by the difference in time.

Our measurement of the average velocity gets closer to the instantaneous velocity when we make the time interval $h$ smaller. But how small?

In the decades after Newton and Leibniz published their work inventing calculus, there was much philosophical concern about $h$. Skeptics pointed out the truth that either $h$ is zero or it is not. If it is zero, then the slope function would be $${\cal D}_t Z(t) \equiv \frac{Z(t+0) - Z(t)}{0} = \frac{Z(t) - Z(t)}{0} = \frac{0}{0}\ .$$ This $0/0$ is not a proper arithmetical quantity. On the other hand, if $h$ is not zero, then the slope function is a human construction involving $h$, not a natural one where $h$ plays no role.

Newton and Leibniz could not address skeptics except by using suggestive but as yet undefined words. These amount to saying "$h$ vanishes," or "$h$ is an infinitesimal," or "$h$ is a nascent quantity." 



Another good image of $h$ becoming as small as possible comes from University of Oxford mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898).  In *Alice in Wonderland*, Dodgson introduced the character of the Cheshire Cat.

The most famous of the early calculus skeptics, George Berkeley (1685-1753), used decried the vanishing $h$ as "notional shadowy Entities." Another of his critical words, "evanescent," has a more physical meaning. The dictionary definition of evanescent is, "tending to vanish like vapor."^[[Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evanescent)] In Berkeley's era, the appearance and vanishing of a vapor might well have been a mysterious process and Berkeley used it as a criticism. 

It will therefore be a relief to the student starting out in calculus that Berkeley himself was not skeptical about the calculations used. He wrote in *The Analysis*, "I have no Controversy about your Conclusions, but only about your Logic and Method." 

Further security is provided by the development, by the 1850s, of a workable theory of vanishing $h$ was accepted by the mathematics community. Often, this theory---the "theory of limits"---is taught as the centerpiece of introductory calculus. But in my view, a theory demonstrating that a thing is true should always be subsidiary to the thing itself. For the uses of calculus, the theory of limits is of little direct use.

To give you a sense for the meaning of evanescent $h$ by way of a physical analogy, consider the process of painting.

For most people it's evident that a can of paint contains a liquid which somehow becomes a solid when brushed on a wall or other object. A better way to think about paint is as a "colloid," small solid particles suspended in a liquid. The purpose of the liquid is to keep the solid particles separate, so that the paint can flow and conform to the surface of the object being painted. Spreading out the liquid on the surface leads to rapid evaporation so that only the solid particles remain. Without the liquid, the particles no longer flow. They remain in place.

In the expression $${\cal D}_t p(t) \equiv \frac{p(t+h) - p(t)}{h}$$ 
the quantity $h$ is the liquid and each value of the input is a particle of solid. $h$ separates the solid particles. $p(t+h)$ and $p(t)$ are the values of the function at the slightly separated inputs. Since the inputs are held slightly apart, the function values $p(t+h)$ and $p(t)$ can be distinct and the difference between them, $p(t+h) - p(t)$, can be non-zero. The final result is to remove the $h$ from the difference, that is, divide $p(t+h)-p(t)$ by $h$. By slightly separating the input values, $h$ makes its contribution to the process, but in the end, $h$ evaporates just like the liquid in paint. That's why $h$ is evanescent: eventually it vanishes like vapor. 

## Evanescence algebraically

Let's look at a slope function using evanescent $h$. To start, we'll analyze $f(t) \equiv t^2$, one of our pattern-book functions. By definition, 
$${\cal D}_t f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}\ .$$
We can easily evaluate $f(t+h)$ symbolically:
$$f(t+h) \equiv (t+h)^2 = t^2 + 2 t h + h^2$$
Similarly, we can find the difference $f(t+h) - f(t)$. It is
$$f(t+h) - f(t) = f(t+h) - t^2 = 2 t h + h^2\ .$$
Notice that there is still some liquid (that is, $h$) in the difference. Now we let the difference start to dry, taking out the $h$ by dividing the difference by $h$:
$$\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} = \frac{2 t h + h^2}{h} = 2 t + h\ .$$
The rate of chaange of $f(t)$ has something solid---$2 t$---along with a little bit of liquid $h$ that we can leave to evaporate to nothing.

## Differentiation

By this point you should be familiar with the definition of the average rate of change of $f(t)$ over an interval from $t$ to $t+h$:

$${\cal D}_t f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}$$
To indicate that we want a rate of change with evanescent $h$, we add a statement to that effect:

$$\partial_t f(t) \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} {\cal D}_t f(t) = \lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}\ .$$
A proper mathematical phrasing of $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ is, "the limit as $h$ goes to zero." In terms of the paint metaphor, you might read $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ as, "once applied to the wall, let the paint dry."

To avoid the long-windedness of $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} {\cal D}_t f(t)$, we write it in a more compact way: $\partial_t f(t)$. We use a small symbol, $\partial$, as a reminiscence of the role that small $h$ played in the construction of $\partial_t f(t)$.

The function $\partial_t f(t)$ is called the ***derivative*** of the function $f(t)$. The process of constructing the derivative of a function is called ***differentiation***. The roots of these two words are not the same. "Differentiation" comes from "difference," a nod to subtraction as in "the difference between 4 and 3 is 1." In contrast, "derivative" comes from "derive," whose dictionary definition is "optain something from a specified source," as in deriving butter from cream. "Derive" is a general term not necessarily related to functions or even to rates of change. But "derivative" always refers to a specific from of derivation, the form we call "differentiation." 

## Derivatives of the pattern book functions {#sec-d-pattern-book}

The pattern-book functions are so widely used that it's helpful to memorize facts about their derivatives. Remember that, as always, the derivative of a function is another function. For the pattern-book functions, the derivative of each function is closely related to one or another of the pattern-book functions themselves, a fact that we'll emphasize by using the *names* of the functions.  

::: {.column-margin}
It's not a coincidence that the derivatives of the pattern-book functions are themselves constructed from the pattern book functions. 
:::

- $\partial_x$ one(x) $=$ zero(x)
- $\partial_x$ identity(x) $=$ one(x)
- $\partial_x$ square(x)   $=$ 2 identity(x)
- $\partial_x$ reciprocal(x) $=$ -1/square(x)
- $\partial_x$ log(x)  $=$ reciprocal(x)
- $\partial_x$ sin(x)  $=$ cos(x)
- $\partial_x$ exp(x)  $=$ exp(x)
- $\partial_x$ sigmoid(x) $=$ gaussian(x)
- $\partial_x$ gaussian(x) $=$ - x gaussian(x)

We'll confirm these equalities in Chapter @sec-computing-derivs. 

::: {.column-margin}
In applications, the pattern-book functions are parameterized, e.g. $\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P} t\right)$. In Chapter @sec-prod-comp-rules we will introduce the derivatives of the parameterized functions.

Notice that $h$ does not appear at all in the table of derivatives. Instead, to use the derivatives of the pattern-book functions we need only refer to a list of facts, not the process for discovering those facts.
