# Constructing derivatives {#sec-computing-derivs}

```{r child="../starter.Rmd"}
```

This chapter shows you how to use the computer to construct the derivative of any function. As you will see, this is easy because the task of constructing derivatives is well suited to the computer. [There are functions where the derivative cannot be meaningfully defined. Examples are the absolute-value function or the Heaviside function which we introduced when discussing piecewise functions in Chapter @sec-piecewise-intro.  In Chapter @sec-cont-and-smooth we will consider the pathological cases and show you how to spot them at a glance.]{.aside} 

We'll demonstrate two methods:

1. ***Symbolic differentiation***, which transforms an algebraic formula for a function into a corresponding algebraic formula for the derivative.

2. ***Finite-difference*** methods that use a "small"---but not evanescent---$h$.

Later, in Chapter @sec-cont-and-smooth, you will learn the algorithms used by the computer in constructing a symbolic derivative. One reason for teaching you to do with paper and pencil the simpler sorts of problems that the computer does perfectly is similar to the reasons you learned basic arithmetic by hand even though a calculator can perform the task more reliably. Another reason to learn to carry out symbolic differentiation on your own is to enable you to follow textbook or classroom uses of formulas which often involve differentiation. 

## Why differentiate?

Before showing you the easy computer-based methods for constructing the derivative of a function, it's good to provide some motivation: Why is differentiation such a common operation in so many fields of study and application?

A primary reason lies in the laws of physics. In its modern form, calculus was invented specifically to be able to describe precisely the nature of motion. Newton's second law relating force to acceleration is built on derivatives. If the position of a moving object as a function of time is $x(t)$, then the velocity is $v(t) \equiv \partial_t x(t)$ and the acceleration is $a(t) \equiv \partial_t v(t) = \partial_{tt} x(t)$. Derivatives are also central to the expression of more modern forms of physics such as quantum theory and general relativity.

Many relationships encountered in the everyday or technical worlds are more understandable if framed in terms of derivatives. For instance,

- Electrical power is the rate of change with respect to time of electrical energy.
- Birth rate is one component of the rate of change with respect to time of population. (The others are the death rate and the rates immigration and emigration.)
- Interest, as in bank interest or credit card interest, is the rate of change with respect to time of assets. 
- Inflation is the rate of change with respect to time of prices.
- Disease incidence is one component of the rate of change with respect to time of disease prevalence. (The other components are death or recovery from disease.)
- Force is the rate of change with respect to position of energy.
- Deficit (as in spending deficits) is the change with respect to time of debt.

It's common to know something about one of these function-and-derivative pairs, but to need to translate this knowledge into the form of the other. Many modeling situations call for putting together different components of change to reveal how some other quantity of interest will change. For example, modeling the financial viability of retirement programs such as the US Social Security involves looking at the changing age structure of the population, the returns on investment, the changing cost of living, and so on. In Block @sec-dynamics-part, we'll use derivatives explicitly to construct models of systems, such as an outbreak of disease, with many changing parts.

Derivatives also play an important role in design. They play an important role in the construction and representation of smooth curves, such as a robot's track or the body of a car. (See Chapter @sec-splines.) Control systems that work to stabilize the flight of a plane or regulate the speed and spacing of cars are based on derivatives. The notion of "stability" itself is defined in terms of derivatives. (See Chapter @sec-equilibria.) Algorithms for optimizing design choices also often make use of derivatives. (See Chapter @sec-optimization-and-constraint.)

::: {.intheworld  data-latex=""}
Economics as a field makes considerable use of concepts of calculus---particularly first and second derivatives, the subjects of this Block---although the names used are peculiar to economics, for instance, "elasticity", "marginal returns" and "diminishing marginal returns."

The origins of modern economics, especially the theory of the free market, are attributed to a book published in 1776, *The Wealth of Nations*. The author, Adam Smith (1723-1790), lays out dozens of relationships between different quantities --- wages, labor, stock, interest, prices, profits, and coinage among others. Yet despite the invention of calculus a century before *Wealth of Nations*, the book does not make any use of calculus.

Consider this characteristic statement in *Wealth of Nations*:

>  *The market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between the quantity which is brought to market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the commodity.*

Without calculus and the ideas of functions and their derivatives, Smith was not able to think about prices in a modern way where price is shaped by demand and supply. Instead, for Smith, each item has a "natural price": a fixed quantity that depends on the amount of labor used to produce the item. Nowadays, we understand that productivity changes as new methods of production and new inventions are introduced. But Smith lived near the end of a centuries-long period of ***static*** economies. Transportation, agriculture, manufacture, population were all much as they had been for the past 500 years or longer. James Watt's steam engine was introduced only in 1776 and it would be decades before it was adapted to the myriad uses of steam power that characterized the 19th century. The cotton gin (1793), labor-saving agricultural machines such as the McCormick reaper (1831), the assembly line (1901), and the many other innovations of industry all lay in the future when Smith was writing *Wealth of Nations*.

```


It took the industrial revolution and nearly a century of intellectual development before economics had to and could embrace the rapid changes in the production process. In this dynamical view, supply and demand are not seen as mere quantities, but as ***functions*** of which price is the major input. The tradition in economics is to use the word "curve" instead of "function," giving us the phrases "supply curve" and "demand curve." Many students starting out in economics conceive of supply and demand as fixed quantities. Making the transition from quantity to function, that is, between a single amount and a relationship between amounts, is a core challenge to those learning economics.

## Symbolic differentiation

The R/mosaic function `D()` takes a formula for a function and produces the derivative. It uses the same sort of tilde expression used by `makeFun()` or `contour_plot()` or the other R/mosaic tools.  For instance,

```{r}
D(t * sin(t) ~ t)
```

If you prefer, you can use `makeFun()` to define a function, then hand that function to `D()` for differentiation.

```{r}
myf <- makeFun(sqrt(y * pnorm(1 + x^2, mean=2, sd=3)) ~ x & y)
dx_myf <- D(myf(x, y) ~ x, y=3)
dx_myf
```

In the right side of the tilde expression handed off to `D()` names the with-respect-to input. This is similar to the tilde expressions used in plotting, which name the inputs that form the graphics domain. But it contrasts with the tilde expressions in `makeFun()`, where the right-hand side specifies the order in which you want the inputs to appear.

::: {.example data-latex=""}
Needless to say, `D()` knows the rules for the derivatives of the pattern-book functions introduced in Section @sec-d-pattern-book. For instance,

```{r}
D(sin(t) ~ t)
D(log(x) ~ x)
D(exp(x) ~ x)
D(x^2 ~ x)
```

## Finite-quotient derivatives

Whenever you have a formula amenable to the construction of a symbolic derivative, that's what you should use. Finite-quotient derivatives are useful in those situation where you don't have such a formula. The calculation is simple but has a weakness that points out the advantages of the evanescent-$h$ approach.

For a function $f(x)$ and a "small," non-zero number $h$, the finite-quotient approximates the derivative with this formula:

$$\partial_x f(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}\ .$$
To demonstrate, let's construct the finite-quotient approximation to $\partial_x \sin(x)$. Since we already know the symbolic derivative---it is $\partial_x \sin(x) = \cos(x)$---there's no genuinely practical purpose for this demonstration. Still, it can serve to confirm the symbolic rule.

We'll call the finite-quotient approximation `fq_sin()` and use `makeFun()` to construct it:

```{r}
fq_sin <- makeFun((sin(x+h)- sin(x-h))/(2*h) ~ x, h=0.01)
```

Notice that `fq_sin()` has a parameter, `h`. In the above line we have set a default value of `h = 0.01`. That may look to you like a "small" value for $h$ but, as we'll see, it is not enough to just to propose a small value, you need to confirm that it is genuinely small in the particular context in which it is being used.

To confirm that `fq_sin()` is an approximation to the genuine $\partial_x \sin(x)$, we exploit our knowledge that $\partial_x \sin(x) = \cos(x)$. @fig-confirm-fq-sin plots out the difference between the the approximation and the genuine derivative.

```{r}
#| label: fig-confirm-fq-sin
#| fig-cap: "Comparing `fq_sin()` to $\\partial_x \\sin(x)$ for two values of $h$."
slice_plot(fq_sin(x, h=0.01) - cos(x) ~ x, domain(x=-10:10)) %>%
  slice_plot(fq_sin(x, h=0.001) - cos(x) ~ x, color="magenta") %>%
  gf_labs(y="Error from true value.")
```

You'll need to look carefully at the scale of the vertical axis in @fig-confirm-fq-sin to see what's happening. For $h=0.01$, `fq_sin()` is not exactly the same as `cos()`, but it is close, always being within $\pm$0.00017. For many purposes, this would be accurate enough. But not for all purposes. We can make the approximation better by using a smaller $h$. For instance, the $h=0.001$ version of `fq_sin()` is accurate to within $\pm$0.0000017.

In practical use, one employs the finite-quotient method in those cases where one does *not already know* the exact derivative function. This would be the case, for example, if the function is a sound wave recorded in the form of an MP3 audio file.

In such situations, a practical way to determine what is a small $h$ is to pick one based on your understanding of the situation. For example, much of what we perceive of sound involves mixtures of sinusoids with periods longer than one-two-thousandth of a second, so you might start with $h$ of 0.002 seconds. Use this guess about $h$ to construct a candidate finite-quotient approximation. Then, construct another candidate using a smaller `h`, say, 0.0002 seconds. If the two candidates are a close match to one another, then you have confirmed that your choice of $h$ is adequate.

It's tempting to think that the approximation gets better and better as `h` is made smaller. But that's not true for computer calculations. The reason is that quantities on the computer have only a limited precision: about 15 digits. To illustrate, let's calculate a simple quantity, $(\sqrt{3})^2 - 3$. Mathematically, this quantity is exactly zero. But on the computer, it is small in magnitude, but not exactly zero:

```{r}
sqrt(3)^2 - 3
```

We can see this sort of loss of precision at work if we make `h` very small in the finite-quotient approximation to $\partial_x \sin(x)$. In @fig-too-small-h we are using `h = 0.000000000001`. The result is unsatisfactory.

```{r}
#| label: fig-too-small-h
#| fig-cap: "In computer calculations, using too small an `h` leads to a loss of accuracy in the finite-quotient approximation."
#| column: margin
slice_plot(fq_sin(x, h=0.000000000001) - cos(x) ~ x, domain(x=-10:10)) %>%
  slice_plot(fq_sin(x, h=0.0000000000001) - cos(x) ~ x, color="magenta") %>%
  gf_labs(y="Error from true value.")
```

## Second and higher-order derivatives

Many applications call for differentiating a derivative or even differentiating the derivative of a derivative. In English, such phrases are hard to read. They are much simpler using mathematical notation.

- $f(x)$ a function
- $\partial_x f(x)$ the derivative of $f(x)$ 
- $\partial_x \partial_x f(x)$, the ***second derivative*** of $f(x)$, usually written even more concisely as $\partial_{xx}f f(x)$.

There are third-order derivatives, fourth-order, and on up. These are not encountered as often as first- and second-order derivatives.

To compute a second-order derivative $\partial_{xx} f(x)$, first differentiate $f(x)$ to produce $\partial_x f(x)$. Then, still using the techniques described earlier in this chapter, differentiate $\partial_x f(x)$. 

There's a short-cut for constructing high-order derivatives using `D()` in a single step. On the right-hand side of the tilde expression, list the with-respect-to name repeatedly. For instance:

- The second derivative $\partial_{xx} \sin(x)$:

```{r}
D(sin(x) ~ x & x)
```

- The third derivative $\partial_{xxx} \ln(x)$:

```{r}
D(log(x) ~ x & x & x)
```

::: {.example data-latex=""}
Physics students learn a formula for the position of an object in free fall dropped from a height $x_0$ and at an initial velocity $v_0$:
$$ x(t) \equiv -\frac{1}{2} g t^2 + v_0 t + x_0\ .$$
The acceleration of the object is the second derivative $\partial_{tt} x(t)$. Use `D()` to find the object's acceleration.

The second derivative of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$ is:

```{r warning=FALSE}
D(0.5*g*t^2 + v0*t + x0 ~ t & t)
```

The acceleration does not depend on $t$; it is the constant $g$. No wonder $g$ is called "gravitational acceleration."
