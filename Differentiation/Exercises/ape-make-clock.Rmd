Using numerical finite-difference differentiation, confirm the rules given in Section @sec-d-pattern-book for the pattern-book functions. 

a) Find a small-enough $h$ so that the error over the domain 0 to 1 is less than $10^{-6}$.

b) Find an even smaller $h$ that produces a substantially larger error than in (a).
