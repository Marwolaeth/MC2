The US National Weather Service provides this graphic for calculating the "heat index." [Source link](https://www.weather.gov/images/oun/wxsafety/summerwx/heatindex.gif)  The output is the heat index, shown both quantitatively (the labels on the contours) and with color. 


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(("www/weather-service-heatindex.png"))
```

1. At a relative humidity of 30% and a temperature of 90 F give a numerical estimate (with units!) for the following quantities:
    i. The partial derivative of heat index with respect to temperature.     ii. The partial derivative of heat index with respect to humidity.
    
2. Is the gradient vector longer on the left side of the graph than on the right side of the graph?

3. Is the gradient vector longer for high temperatures than for low temperatures?
