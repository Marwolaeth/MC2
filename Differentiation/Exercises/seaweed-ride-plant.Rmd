UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

Turn this into an exercise for writing the Taylor polynomial of $\sin()$ when the input has units of degrees.

You could equally well say that the $\sin()$ function has a characteristic scale of 360 ***degrees***, which is the same amount as $2 \pi$ ***radians***. Most people find it easiest to interpret angles as measured in degrees, but the usual practice in mathematics and computing is that the argument to $\sin()$ (and other trigonometric functions is interpreted) in radians. You might think the choice between using degrees and using radians is arbitrary. In @sec-taylor-polynomial you will see a surprising reason why radians are the "natural" way to measure angles.
