## Systems 


4. Systems of nonlinear differential equations
    a. Objectives/topics
        i. Understand the format of presentations of dynamics (vector fields) and trajectories ( x vs t, y         i. vs t or phase plane)
        i. Finding solutions graphically (flow fields)
        i. Dependence on initial condition
