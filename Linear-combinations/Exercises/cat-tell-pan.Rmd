DRAFT

Exercises constructing functions with different explanatory variables. Compare R^2^. Plot the functions created? Do the interaction terms, etc. help?

Exercises confirming that `qr.solve()` produces results that are as they should be: residual orthogonal to every vector in A, projected + residual = $\vec{b}$.

Exercises confirming that adding more columns to A produces a smaller residual.

Demonstration that even random vectors can be combined to exactly equal $\vec{b}$, so long as we have enough of them.
