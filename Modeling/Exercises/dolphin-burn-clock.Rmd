The diagram shows how the intensity of light from the sun depends on distance $r$. [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) The intensity is the number of photons per unit **area**. Imagining each red line to be the path followed by one photon, the intensity can be calculated by the area of the surfaces at distance $r$, $2r$, and $3r$.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/Inverse_square_law.png")
```

```{r dbck-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="Which of these functional forms best models intensity $\\cal I$ as a function of distance $r$?",
  "Proportional: $\\cal I(r)\\equiv ar+b",
  "+Power-law: $\\cal I(r)\\equiv Ar^p$+",
  "Exponential $\\cal I(r)\\equiv Ae^{kr}+C$",
  "Sine: $\\cal I(r)\\equiv A\sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{p}(r-r_0)\right )+B$",
  "Sigmoid $\\cal I(r)\\equiv A\cdot pnorm(r,mean,sd)+B$",
  "Gaussian $\\cal I(r)\\equiv A\cdot dnorm(r,mean,sd)+B$"
)
```
