@fig-solar-june-c2 comes from the monitoring app for a photovoltaic (solar electricity) array on two consecutive days in June 2022. These data were presented first in exercise `r ref_ex("KINWgK")`, where you were asked to model the June 3 pattern as a hump function solar(t) multiplied by an irregular function cloudiness(t) with a domain between 0 (full cloudiness) and 1 (no clouds). The June 4 pattern is taken as the hump solar(t).

With that multiplicative model in mind, take a closer look at @fig-solar-june-c2, particularly for the early part of the day. In the interval from 6 to 9 am, the June 4 power production is below that of June 3. 

1. How is this inconsistent with the "power(t) $\equiv$ solar(t) $\times$ cloudiness(t)" model?

2. The June 4 data starts low and then increases steeply around 9am. What evidence is there that the actual solar(t) function has a smoother increase? <!-- The June 3 data follows a hump shape for the early part of the day that matches well with June 4 at about 9am. -->

3. Having in mind the modeling cycle, how might you modify the model simply to make it consistent with the data? (Hint: Is June 4 really a hump?) <!-- Construct solar(t) piecewise as the June 3 pattern for early in the day and June 4 after 9am. -->

Note: At the end of the day, both the June 3 and June 4 data show an extra bump of a sort not seen in the pattern-book gaussian hump function. Potentially this could be due to cloudiness, but the amount of cloudiness would have to be exactly the same for June 3 and 4, which seem unlikely. More realistically, the bump represents an earlier fall off due to shadows of trees as the evening sun get low in the sky.
