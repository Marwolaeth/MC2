The performance $p$ of a worker depends on the level of stimulation/stress $s$ imposed by the task. This phenomenon has come to be known as the *Yerkes-Dodson Stress Performance Curve*, and **you've probably experienced this yourself.** If a task is not stimulating enough people become inactive/bored and performance is negatively impacted. If tasks are over stimulating (stressful), people become anxious, fatigued, and burn-out. The overall pattern is shown by the diagram.

```{r hhmz-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt="Which of these functional forms best imitates the Yerkes-Dodson stress performance curve?",
  "Proportional: $p(s) \\equiv as+b$",
  "Power-law: $p(s) \\equiv As^p$",
  "Exponential $p(s) \\equiv Ae^{kt}+C$",
  r"(Sine: $p(s) \equiv A\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{p}(t-t_0)\right)+B$)",
  "Sigmoid $p(s) \\equiv A\\cdot pnorm(s,mean,sd)+B$",
  "+Gaussian $p(s) \\equiv A\\cdot dnorm(s,mean,sd)+B$+",

A manager must balance workloads between too much and too little stimulation to get peak performance out of each team member.
