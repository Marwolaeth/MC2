DAY LENGTH


See paper at <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.1043.pdf>

NOT SURE ABOUT THE EQUATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING. 2/15 is the conversion of the angle-hour of sunrise into daylight length: multiply by 2 to take both morning and afternoon into account. 15 is in degrees per hour to convert the angle (in degrees) into hours. 

::: {.example data-latex=""}
Anyone who lives far from the equator is familiar with the annual cycle of short winter days and long summer days. The magnitude of this cycle is a function of ***latitude***: the further away from the equator the larger the winter-summer day-length difference. 

A simple model accounts for the length of daylight (in hours) as a function of latitude $L$ and the declination angle $\delta$ of the sun. 

$$\text{daylight}(L, \delta) \equiv {\small\frac{2}{15}} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(\delta)\right)$$

Composing day_length$(L, \delta)$ onto $\delta(doy)$ gives the length of daylight as a function of day of the year:
$$\text{daylight}(L, doy) \equiv {\small\frac{2}{15}} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(\delta(doy))\right)\ .$$
Function composition enables us to transform a function that takes one kind of thing as input (declination in this example) and turn it into a function that takes another kind of thing as input (day of year).

The declination angle is the latitude of the point on the earth's surface pierced by an imagined line connecting the centers of the earth and the sun. This angle is a function of the "day of year" ($doy$) measured as 0 at midnight before January 1 and 365.25 at the midnight ending December 31.

Declination angle as a function of day-of-year: 

$\delta(doy) = 23.44 \sin\left({\small\frac{2\pi}{365.25}} (doy+9)\right)$

The output has units in degrees.

Composing functions is very common in computer programming. Consider these two functions


A computer implementation must look different, since $L$ and $\delta$ are typically provided in degrees while the `tan()` and other trigonometric functions in most computer languages expect units of radians. The conversion is easy: $\text{deg2rad}(d) \equiv \frac{\pi}{180} d$. The conversion the other way is $\text{rad2deg}(r) \equiv \frac{180}{\pi} r$.

To get the day-length formula to work in a computer, we can compose the $\tan()$ function with `deg2rad()`. The output of `acos()` is in radians, so we have to convert it back to degrees. Like this:

```{r}
day_length <- makeFun(
  (2/15)*rad2deg(
    acos(
      -tan(deg2rad(L))*tan(deg2rad(d))
    )
  ) ~ L & d)
```


Now to make a plot of day length as a function of day of the year. Of course, `day_length(L, d)` does not take day of the year into account. What's missing is to know the declination of the sun as a function of calendar day.

The input is a number $n$ that runs from 0 at the start of January 1st to 365 at the end of December 31. In terms of this input, the declination of the sun is known to be approximately
```{r}
delta_sun <- makeFun(-23.44*cos((2*pi/365)*(n+10) ) ~ n)
```

Composing `day_length()` with `delta_sun()` (on the `d` argument only), and setting the latitude to be, say, $39^\circ$N,  we get a function of day of year `n`:
```{r}
slice_plot(
  day_length(39, delta_sun(n)) ~ n, 
  bounds(n=c(0,365))
  )
```

```{r day-length-cos, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Using an R console, calculate the length of the day at latitude $39^\\circ$ on the longest day of the year, which is when the declination of the sun is $23.44^\\circ$. How long is it?",
  "13.9 hours",
  "+14.7 hours+",
  "14.9 hours",
  "15.1 hours",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
