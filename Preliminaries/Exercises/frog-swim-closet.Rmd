Consider this interactive contour plot:

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
surface_plot(exp(-z)*sin(y) ~ y & z, interval(y=-3:3, z=0:2), type="contour")
```

1. Find a value for the (x, y) inputs where the function output is about -0.35.

2. Find a value for the (x, y) inputs where the function output is about 0.9.

3. One contour goes through the input A=(x=1.53, y=1.59). The neighboring contour goes through B=(x=1.53, y=0.90). What is the function output half-way between these two points, at input C=(x=1.53, y=1.25)? How does the output at C relate to the output at A and B?

4. Choose one of the contours and track the output as you move the cursor along that contour. What pattern do you see in the output?
