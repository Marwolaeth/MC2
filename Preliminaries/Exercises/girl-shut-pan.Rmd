```{r gspf-01, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  prompt=r"(Which of the following R expressions creates a graph of the function $\sin(z)$ with a graphics domain from $-4\leq z \leq 5$?)",
"`slice_plot(sin(x), domain(x=-4:5))`",
"`slice_plot(sin(z) ~ x, domain(x=-4:5))`",
"`slice_plot(sin(z), domain(z=-4:5))`",
"+`slice_plot(sin(z) ~ z, domain(z=-4:5))`+" = "Right! You have to use the variable name in the tilde (~) expression, and then use the same variable name when specifying the graphics domain."
)
```

*Hint #1: You can try copying and running each expression in an R console  to check your answer.*
