As detailed in @sec-doubling-time, the exponential function has a unique (and important!) property: "doubling in constant time." Let's call this "constant time" $\tau$. 

In algebraic terms, for any input $t$ this relationship holds:
$$\exp(t + \tau) = 2 \exp(t)\ .$$ Use this fact, and the symbolic manipuation techniques in @sec-exp-log-symb to calculate a numerical value for $\tau$. Show your symbolic derivation. (Hint: You will need to use one of the pattern-book functions to compute the numerical answer.)
