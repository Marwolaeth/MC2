The US National Weather Service provides this graphic for calculating the "heat index." [Source link](https://www.weather.gov/images/oun/wxsafety/summerwx/heatindex.gif)  The output is the heat index, shown both quantitatively (the labels on the contours) and with color. 


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/weather-service-heatindex.png"))
```

1. How many input variables are there? 

2. What's the function output when air temperature is 90 F and humidity is 50%?

3. True or false: Holding humidity constant, as the air temperature rises, the heat index also increases. 

4. True or false: Holding air temperature constant, as humidity rises the heat index also rises. 

5. True or false: Heat index increases with temperature at a different rate when the humidity is low compared to when the humidity is high.

6. True or false: Heat index increases with temperature most rapidly when the humidity is low.

7. Consider this statement: "When the air temperature is 102 F  and the relative humidity is 77%, the wet-bulb temperature is about 95 F." Is "heat index" the same as "wet-bulb temperature?"
