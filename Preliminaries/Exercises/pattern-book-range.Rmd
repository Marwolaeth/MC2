A function's ***domain*** is the set of possible inputs to the function. A function's ***range*** is the set of possible outputs.

In each of the following questions, choose the correct answer from these possibilities:

- **All**: All
- **Pos**: The positive numbers (excluding zero)
- **Neg**: The negative numbers (excluding zero)
- **NonNeg**: The non-negative numbers
- **Closed**: Closed.

```{r nrlp2-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the range of the pattern-book **exponential** function?",
  "+Pos+", "NonNeg", "Neg", 
  "All", "Closed",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r nrlp2-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the range of the pattern-book **sine** function?",
  "Pos", "Neg", 
  "All", "+Closed+" = "Yes. The output of pattern-book sinusoid functions is always in the interval from -1 to 1, inclusive",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r nrlp2-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the range of the pattern-book **logarithm** function?",
  "Pos", "NonNeg", "Neg", 
  "+All+", "Closed",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r nrlp2-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the range of the pattern-book **square** function?",
  "Pos" = "Close. Zero is one of the possible outputs. We can say, equivalently, that the range is all the **positive outputs plus 0** or all the **non-negative** outputs.", "+NonNeg+", "Neg", 
  "All", "Closed",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r nrlp2-5, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the range of the pattern-book **proportional** function?",
  "Pos", "Neg", 
  "+All+", "Closed" = "The range extends from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r nrlp2-6, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What is the range of the pattern-book **sigmoid** function?",
  "Pos", "NonNeg", "Neg", 
  "All", "+Closed+" = "Right. The pattern-book sigmoid function has an output that is always in the interval $0 \\leq \\pnorm(x) \\leq 1 .$",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
