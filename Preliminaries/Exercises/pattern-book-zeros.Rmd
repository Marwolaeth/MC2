Run this graph-making command in your console:

```{r}
slice_plot(exp(x) ~ x, domain(x=-3:3))
```

In this exercise, you will be modifying the sandbox code to draw different functions, so you can examine their shapes.

Your task is to read and interpret the graphs of the basic modeling functions. Here, you will be looking for ***zero-crossings***: the neighborhood of a point in the function's domain where the **output** of the function is negative for inputs on one side and positive for inputs on the other side. If zero is touched but not crossed, we will call that "touched zero."

The table below lists the pattern-book functions. For each function in the list, fill in the table. That is, say whether the function crosses zero, touches zero but does not cross, or does not touch at all in the part of the domain shown in the graphic: $-3 \leq x \leq 3$. Also note if the value of the function appears to be reaching a horizontal asymptote at zero for very negative $x$, for very positive $x$, for both, or neither.
