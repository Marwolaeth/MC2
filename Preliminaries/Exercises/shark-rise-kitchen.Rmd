Use an R console to make this plot.

```{r eval=FALSE}
slice_plot(log(x) ~ x, domain(x=-5:5))
```

1. Explain why the function graph doesn't cover the whole domain indicated in the command.

2. Calculate `log(-5)`. What is the result?

The answer to (2) demonstrates an important feature of modern computer numerics. When an input is outside of the domain of the function, the function value is undefined. This "undefined" value is represented by a special "number," which has no value. In fact, the value stands for "not a number." 

3. Do some arithmetic with `NaN`, for instance, adding 5 or multiplying by 3. Explain the results.
