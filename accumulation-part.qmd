# BLOCK IV. Accumulation {#sec-accumulation-part .unnumbered}

We have already studied the relationship between functions and their derivatives. In this Block, we will examine techniques that exploit that relationship to re-construct a function from knowledge of its derivative by a process called ***anti-differentiation***.

Just as derivatives tell about rates of change, anti-derivatives tell about the ***accumulation*** of change.
