<p>In Chapter <a href="01-modeling-change.html">Section&nbsp;<span>1</span></a> we encouraged you to think of a function in terms of the space of possible inputs—the domain—and another space of outputs. In this chapter, we introduce ways to visualize the input and output space of a function together.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a space suitable for representing a single quantity. That is, of course, the familiar number line.</p>
<div class="cell page-columns page-full" data-layout-align="center" data-fig.showtext="false">

<p><img src="www/number-line2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:90.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On the number line, any specific quantity is a single point. For instance, let’s use the number line to show the two quantities <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}{6.3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\color{magenta}{-4.5}\)</span>.</p>

<p>A <strong><em>function</em></strong> connects each point in the input space to a corresponding point in the output space. Figure <a href="#fig-show-lines-function">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> gives a sketch of an arbitrary function where the input and output spaces are shown one above the other. Arrows are drawn for several input values, showing where those values are mapped to in the output space. (There are infinitely more arrows to be drawn in between those shown, but the graphic would become illegible.)</p>

<p>In everyday speech, the word “graphic” refers to any drawing. In mathematics, a “graph” is a drawing made in the Cartesian plane, with the input values marked by the horizontal axis and the function output marked by the vertical axis.</p>
</div></div><p><a href="#fig-show-lines-function">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> gives information about the function, but it is in a format that is almost impossible to interpret. Renė Descartes (1596–1650) proposed a better visualization: place the input and output spaces at right angles to one another and, instead of the head and tail of the arrows connecting corresponding positions on the input and on the output spaces, use the head and tail values as coordinates in the joint input/output space. This setup is shown in <a href="#fig-graph1">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a> and is called, as you know, the <strong><em>graph</em></strong> of the function.</p>
<div class="cell" data-layout-align="center" data-fig.showtext="false">

<p></p><figcaption aria-hidden="true" class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2: The mapping from <a href="#fig-show-lines-function">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> translated into the form of a graph. The input space is marked by the horizontal axis and the output space by the vertical axis. Each of the arrows in <a href="#fig-show-lines-function">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> is represented by a point, whose x-coordinate is the position of the tail of the arrow in the input space and whose y-coordinate is the position of the head of the arrow in the output space. This is the <strong><em>graph</em></strong> of the function.</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A major advantage of this format is that the function output can be displayed not just at a discrete set of input values, but at every point in the continuous input space. <a href="#fig-graph1">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a> shows one function consistent with the discrete points, but there are many such functions. That is, the discrete arrows shown in <a href="#fig-show-lines-function">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> do not <em>completely</em> specify a unique function.</p>

<p>Nerve cells communicate via electrical voltages and currents. For long-distance communications (distances longer than about 1 mm) the signaling takes the form of pulses of voltage occurring repetitively at different rates. The formation of these pulses, called “action potentials,” was the subject of an extensive research project in the 1950s involving inserting tiny electrodes into relatively large (“giant”) nerve cells that mediate the fleeing reaction of squid. A typical experiment involved regulating artificially the voltage across the cell membrane. Through these experiments, the scientists— John Eccles, Alan Hodgkin, and Andrew Huxley—were able to describe mathematically the relationship between membrane voltage and the current across the membrane. A calculus model built from the relationships provided a concise description of the biophysics of action potentials. A 1963 Nobel Prize was awarded for this work.</p>
<p>In each experimental run, the membrane voltage was fixed at a given level (say, -50 mV) and the current measured. <a href="#fig-fhn-model">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> shows what the data might have looked like, each point showing the results of one experimental run.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The data points themselves might be described metaphorically as “clouds” spotting the voltage vs current “sky.” Real-world clouds often show patterns such as animal or country shapes. We might say that a given cloud resembles a rabbit. Similarly, the data clouds show a pattern between current and voltage. We might, for instance, describe the current-voltage relationship as S-shaped. Or, rather than using the letter “S” we could draw a curve through the dots to summarize and simplify the relationship.</p>
</div>
<p>The smooth curve in <a href="#fig-fhn-model">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> describes the relationship between current and voltage quantitatively. For example, if you know that the current is 0, you can use the curve to figure out what the voltage will be around -90 mV or -50 mV or -10 mV. But when the current is 0, the voltage will <em>not</em> be, say, -75 or -150.</p>
<p>Graphs such as <a href="#fig-carbon-phases">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.5</span></a> and <a href="#fig-fhn-model">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> are good ways of showing relationships. We can even do calculations simply using such graphs. Place your finger on a point of the S-shaped graph and you can read from the axes an allowed pair of voltage and current values. Place your finger on a point on the vertical axis. Moving it to the curve will reveal what current is associated with that voltage.</p>
<p>Functions are, like graphs, a way of representing relationships. For all their advantages as a means of communication, graphs have their limits. With a graph, it’s feasible only to show the relationship between two quantities or among three quantities. Functions can involve more quantities. For instance, the triangle-area function <span class="math display">\[A(a,b,c) \equiv \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\strut 4a^2b^2-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2}\]</span> gives the relationship between four quantities: the area and the lengths of the triangle’s three sides.</p>
<p>On the other hand, functions cannot represent all types of relationships. For instance, the curve in <a href="#fig-fhn-model">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> shows a relationship between current and voltage in nerve cells. But there is no mathematical function voltage(current) that does justice to the relationship. The reason is that mathematical functions can have <strong><em>one and only one</em></strong> output for any given input. There are three reasonable values for membrane voltage that are experimentally consistent with a zero current, not just one.</p>
<p>Care needs to be taken in using functions to represent relationships. For the nerve-cell current-voltage relationship, for instance, we can construct a function current(voltage) to represent the relationship. That’s because for any given value of voltage there is just one corresponding current. But there is no voltage(current) function, even though knowing the current tells you a lot about the voltage.</p>

<p>Given a function, it’s easy to draw the corresponding relationship as a graphic. This section describes how to do that for functions that have one or two inputs. The opposite—given a relationship, representing it using functions—is usually not so easy and will require modeling techniques that we’ll develop in Block 1.</p>
<p>Contemporary practice is to draw graphs of functions using a computer. R/mosaic provides several functions that do this, you need only learn how to use them.</p>
<p>There are two essential arguments shared by all of the R/mosaic functions drawing a graph:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The function that is to be graphed. This is to be written as a <strong><em>tilde expression</em></strong> in the same manner as described in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?sec-computing-with-R</span>.</li>
<li>The <strong><em>domain interval</em></strong>. The domain of many functions reaches infinity, but our computer screens are not so big! Making a graph requires choosing a finite interval for each of the input quantities.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tilde expression for a function with one input will have only one name on the right-hand side of the <span style="font-size:250%'">~</span>. The domain interval specification must use the same name:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tr class="odd">
<td><code>x^2 ~ x</code></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>y * exp(y) ~ y</code></td>
<td><code>interval(y = 0:10)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>log(y) / exp(y) ~ y</code></td>
<td><code>interval(y = -5:5)</code></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><code>sin(z) / z ~ z</code></td>

<p>Contour plots will be a preferred format for displaying functions with two inputs. The main reason to prefer contour plots is the ease with which locations of points in the input space can be identified and the ability to read output values without much difficulty.</p>

<p>There’s another way to think about graphing functions with two inputs. There are in such a situation <strong>three</strong> quantities involved in the relationship. Two of these are the inputs, the third is the output. A three-dimensional space consists of all the possible coordinate triples; the relationship between the inputs and the output is marked by ruling out almost all of the potential triples and marking those points in the space that are consistent with the function.</p>
<p>the space of all possibilities (y, z, output) is three-dimensional, but very few of those possibilities are consistent with the function to be graphed. You can imagine our putting dots at all of those consistent-with-the-function points, or our drawing lots and lots of continuous curves through those dots, but the cloud of dots forms a <strong><em>surface</em></strong>; a continuous cloud of points floating over the (y, z) input space.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-first-surface">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.7</span></a> displays this surface. Since the image is drawn on a two-dimensional screen, we have to use painters’ techniques of perspective and shading. In the interactive version of the plot, you can move the viewpoint for the image which gives many people a more solid understanding of the surface.</p>

<p>It may take some practice to learn to read contour plots fluently but it is a skill that’s worthwhile to have. Note that the graphics frame is the Cartesian space of the two inputs. The output is presented as <strong><em>contour lines</em></strong>. Each contour line has a label giving the numerical value of the function output. Each of the input value pairs on a given contour line corresponds to an output at the level labeling that contour line. To find the output for an input pair that is <em>not</em> on a contour line, you <strong><em>interpolate</em></strong> between the contours on either side of that point.</p>
<div class="practice">
<p>What’s the value of the function being plotted here at input <span class="math inline">\((\text{input}_1=0, \text{input}_2=0)\)</span>?</p>

</div>
<p>The input pair (0, 0)—which is marked by a small red dot—falls between the contours labeled “20” and “22.” This means that the output corresponding to input (0, 0) is somewhere between 20 and 22. The point is much closer to the contour labeled “20”, so it’s reasonable to see the output value as 20.5. This is, of course, an approximation, but that’s the nature of reading numbers off of graphs.</p>
</div>
<p>Often, the specific numerical value at a point is not of primary interest. Instead, we may be interested in how steep the function is at a point, which is indicated by the spacing between contours. When contours are closely spaced, the hillside is steep. Where contours are far apart, the hillside is not steep, perhaps even flat.</p>
<p>Another common task for interpreting contour plots is to locate the input pair that’s at a local high point or low point: the top of a hill or the bottom of a hollow. Such points are called <strong><em>local argmax</em></strong> or <strong><em>local argmin</em></strong> respectively. The <em>output</em> of the function at a local argmax is called the <strong><em>local maximum</em></strong>; similarly for a local argmin, where the output is called a <strong><em>local minimum</em></strong>. (The word “argmax” is a contraction of “argument of the maximum.” We will tend to use the word “input” instead of “argument”, but it means the same thing to say “the inputs to a function” as saying “the arguments of a function.”)</p>

</ol>
<p>A function is steepest where contour lines are spaced closely together, that is, where the function output changes a lot with a small change in input. This is true near inputs <span class="math inline">\((x=0, y=1)\)</span>. But notice that steepness involves a <em>direction</em>. Near <span class="math inline">\((x=0,y=1)\)</span>, changing the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> value does not lead to a big change in output, but a small change in the value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> leads to a big change in output. In other words, the function is steep in the y-direction but not in the x-direction.</p>
<p>The highest output value explicitly marked in the graph is 8. We can imagine from the shapes of the contours surrounding the 8 contour that the function reaches a peak somewhere in the middle of the region enclosed by the 8 contour, near the input coordinate <span class="math inline">\((x=0, y=-1.5)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the lowest output value marked is -10. In the middle of the area enclosed by the -10 contour is a local low point. That there are two such regions, one centered near input coordinate <span class="math inline">\((x=-0.5, y=3.3)\)</span>, the other at <span class="math inline">\((x=1.5, y=3.1)\)</span>.</p>

<div class="why page-columns page-full">
<p>Why do you call the graphs of functions with one input <strong>slice plots</strong> rather than simply graphs?</p>
<p>Saying “graph” for a display of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is correct and reasonable. But in <em>MOSAIC Calculus</em> we have another point to make.</p>
<p>Almost always, when mathematically modeling a real-world situation or phenomenon, we do not try to capture every nuance of every relationship that might exist in the real world. We leave some things out. Such simplifications make modeling problems easier to deal with and encourage us to identify the most important features of the most important relationships.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this spirit, it’s useful always to assume that our models are leaving something out and that a more complete model involves a function with more inputs than the present candidate. The present candidate model should be considered as a <strong><em>slice</em></strong> of a more complete model. Our slice leaves out one or more of the input quantities in a more complete model.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">As you become practiced reading contour plots, you might prefer to read this one as a hilltop (shaded yellow) side-by-side with a hollow or bowl (shaded purple), with green, almost level flanks at the left and right edges of the frame.</span></div></div>
<p>To illustrate this, suppose that the actual system involves relationships among three quantities, which we represent in the form of a function of two inputs, as shown in <a href="#fig-contour-pre-slice">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.8</span></a>. (The third quantity in the relationship is the output of the function.)</p>
<p>The most common forms of <strong><em>slice</em></strong> involve constructing a simpler function that has one input but not the other. For example, our simpler function might ignore input 22. There are different ways of collapsing the function of two inputs into a function of one input. An especially useful way in calculus is to take the two-input function and set one of the inputs to a <strong><em>constant value</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we set input 22 to the constant value 1.5. This means that we can consider any value of input 1, but input 2 has been replaced by 1.5. In <a href="#fig-contour-slice">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.9</span></a>, we’ve marked in red the points in the contour plot that give the output of the simplified function.</p>

<p>Each point along the red line corresponds to a specific value of input #1. From the contours, we can read the output corresponding to each of those values of input #1. This relationship, output versus input #1 can be drawn as a mathematical graph (to the right of the contour plot). Study that graph until you can see how the rising and falling parts of the graph correspond to the contours being crossed by the red line.</p>
<p>Slices can be taken in any direction or even along a curved path! The blue line in <a href="#fig-one-c-three">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.10</span></a> shows the slice constructed by letting input 2 vary and holding input 1 at the constant value 0.</p>
