# BLOCK V. Dynamics {#sec-dynamics-part .unnumbered}

Often we are interested in real-world systems that change in time, for instance the weather, or the population of a species, or the motion of an object through space. The mathematics relating to changes in time is called ***dynamics***. In this Block, we will explore how to model dynamical systems---systems that change in time---by functions that themselves are static. This paradox of using an unchanging function to describe a changing state can be a boon to the modeler, allowing mathematically simple systems to create rich and complicated phenomena.
