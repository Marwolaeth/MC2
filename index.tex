This project was initiated by the Mathematical Sciences department at
the US Air Force Academy. They recognized that a traditional calculus
introduction is ill-suited to the needs of STEM in the 21st century.

Critical support was given by the \href{http://ardifoundation.org}{ARDI
Foundation} which awarded the
\href{http://www.ardifoundation.org/coors-chair/}{Holland H. Coors Chair
in Education Technology} to one of the project members, Daniel Kaplan.
This made possible a year-long residency at USAFA during which time he
was able to work unhindered on this project.

Macalester College, where Kaplan is DeWitt Wallace Professor of
Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer science, was the site where the
overall framework and many of the materials for a STEM-oriented calculus
were developed. Particularly important in the germination were David
Bressoud and Jan Serie, respectively chairs of the Macalester math and
biology departments, as well as Prof.~Thomas Halverson and Prof.~Karen
Saxe, who volunteered to team teach with Kaplan the first prototype
course. Early grant support from the Howard Hughes Medical Foundation
and the Keck Foundation provided the resources to carry the prototype
course to a point of development where it became the entryway to
calculus for Macalester students.

Profs. Randall Pruim (Calvin University) and Nicholas Horton (Amherst
College) were essential collaborators in developing software to support
calculus in R. They and Kaplan formed the core team of Project MOSAIC,
which was supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF
DUE-0920350).

Joel Kilty and Alex McAllister at Centre College admired the Macalester
course and devoted much work and ingenuity to write a textbook,
\emph{Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus} (Oxford Univ. Press),
implementing their own version. Their textbook enabled us to reduce the
use of sketchy notes in the first offering of this course at USAFA.

\part{Preliminaries}

Calculus is about change, and change is about relationships. Consider
the complex and intricate network of relationships that determine
climate: a changing climate implies that there is a relationship
between, say, global average temperature and time. Scientists know
temperature changes with levels of CO\textsubscript{2} and methane which
themselves change due to their production or elimination by atmospheric
and geological processes. A change in one component of climate (e.g.,
ocean acidification or pH level) provokes change in others.

In order to describe and use the relationships we find in the natural or
designed world, we build mathematical representations of them. We call
these \textbf{\emph{mathematical models}}. On its own, the word
``model'' signifies a representation of something in a format which
serves a specific \textbf{\emph{purpose}}. A blueprint describing the
design of a building is an everyday example of a model. The blueprint
\emph{represents} the building but in a way that is utterly different
from the building itself. Blueprints are much easier to construct or
modify than buildings, they can be carried and shared easily. Two of the
purposes of a blueprint is to aid in the design of buildings and to
communicate that design to the people securing the necessary materials
and putting them together into the building itself.

\marginnote{\begin{footnotesize}

Models provide the link between the real world and the abstractions of
mathematics.

\end{footnotesize}}

Atmospheric scientists build models of climate whose purpose is to
explore scenarios for the future emission of greenhouse gasses. The
model serves as a stand-in for the Earth, enabling predictions in a few
hours of decades of future change in the climate. This is essential for
the development of policies to stabilize the climate.

\marginnote{\begin{footnotesize}

A concise definition of a ``model'' is \emph{a representation for a
purpose}. Defining the \textbf{\emph{purpose}} for your model is a
crucial first step in building a mathematical representation that will
serve that purpose. Useful models of the same real-world setting can be
very different, depending on the purpose. For instance, one routine use
for a model is to make a prediction. But other models are intended for
exploring the connections among the components of the system being
modeled.

\end{footnotesize}}

Designing a building or modeling the climate requires expertise and
skill in a number of areas. Nonetheless, constructing a model is
\emph{relatively easy} compared to the alternative. Models make it
relatively easy to extract the information that's needed for the purpose
at hand. For instance, a blueprint gives a comprehensive overview of a
building in a way that's hard to duplicate just by walking around an
actual building.

Models are easy to manipulate compared to reality, easy to implement
(think ``draw a blueprint'' versus ``construct a building''), and easy
to extract information from. We can build multiple models and compare
and contrast them to gain insight into the real-world situation behind
the models.

A \textbf{\emph{mathematical model}} is a model made out of mathematical
and computational stuff. Example: a bank's account books are a model
made mostly out of numbers. But in technical areas---science and
engineering are obvious examples, but there are many other fields,
too---numbers don't get you very far. By learning calculus, you gain
access to important mathematical and computational concepts and tools
for building models and extracting information from them.

A major use of mathematics is building models constructed out of
mathematical concepts and objects. The chapters in this Preliminaries
section of this book introduce some of the fundamental mathematical
entities that are the heart of modeling.

\textbf{Exercise 2.6} ../Preliminaries/Exercises/fish-sees-tree.Rmd

Open a SANDBOX. (Just click on that link, although you may eventually be
given other ways to open a sandbox.)

\begin{scaffolding}
When you see a breakout box like this, it means that we're providing
some computer code that you can paste into a sandbox and run. For this
exercise, that code is

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \DecValTok{2}
\FunctionTok{sin}\NormalTok{(x)}\SpecialCharTok{*}\FunctionTok{sqrt}\NormalTok{(x)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Paste those two lines into the sandbox and press ``Run code.'' Verify
that you get this as a result:

\texttt{{[}1{]}\ 1.285941}

\end{scaffolding}

Each line that you pasted in the sandbox is a \textbf{\emph{command}}.
The first command gives a value to \(x\). The second command uses that
value for \(x\) to calculate a function output. The function is
\(g(x)\equiv \sin(x) \times \sqrt{\strut x}\).

\begin{why}
Why not simplify the above code to the single line
\texttt{sin(2)*sqrt(2)}? This would produce the same output but would
introduce an ambiguity to the human reader. We want to make it clear to
the reader (and the computer) that whatever \(x\) might be, it should be
used as the input to \textbf{both} the \(\sin()\) and the
\(\sqrt{\strut\ \ \ }\) functions.

\end{why}

In the following questions, numbers have been rounded to two or three
significant digits. Select the answer \emph{closest} to the computer
output.

\textbf{Question A} Change \(x\) to 1. What's the output of
\(\sin(x) \ \sqrt{\strut x}\)

\textbf{Question B} Change \(x\) to 3. What's the output of
\(\sin(x) \  \sqrt{\strut x}\)

~~~~{-1.51{x}}~~~~~~~{0.244{\(\heartsuit\ \)}}~~~~~~~{0.84{︎X
}}~~~~~~~{0.99{x}}~~~~~~~{2.14{x}}~~~~~~~{\texttt{NaN}{x}}

\textbf{Question C} Change \(x\) to \(-5\). What's the output of
\(\sin(x) \  \sqrt{\strut x}\)

  {\texttt{NaN}{Nice!~This stands for Not-a-Number, which is what you
  get when you calculate the square root of a negative input.}}
\end{enumerate}

In the sandbox, change the \textbf{function} to be
\(\sqrt{\strut\pnorm(x)}\).

\textbf{Question D} For \(x=2\), what's the output of
\(\sqrt{\strut\pnorm(x)}\)?

Make this an exercise on ``when things go wrong.''

When your R command is not a complete sentence, the SANDBOX will display
an error like this:

{Error in parse(text = x, keep.source = TRUE) : :5:0: unexpected end of
input }

The ``unexpected end of input'' is the computer's way of saying, ``You
haven't finished your sentence so I don't know what to do.''

Each of these R expressions is incomplete. Your job, which you should do
in a sandbox, is to turn each into a complete expression. Sometimes
you'll have to be creative, since when a sentence is incomplete you,
like the computer, don't really know what it means to say! But each of
these erroneous expressions can be fixed by \textbf{adding} or
\textbf{changing} text.

Open a sandbox and copy each of the items below, one at a time, into a
sandbox. Press ``Run code'' for that item and verify that you get an
error message.

For the first item, the sandbox will look like this:

Then, fix the command so you get a numerical result rather than the
error message.

../Preliminaries/Exercises/seahorse-hear-magnet.Rmd

TURN THIS INTO AN EXERCISE that requires drawing contour graphs and
interpreting them.

A triangle consists of three connected line segments: the sides. It has
other properties that are related to the sides and each other, for
example, the angles between sides, the perimeter, or the area enclosed
by the triangle.

Here's a description of the relationship between the perimeter \(p\) and
the lengths of the sides, \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), written in the form of a
function: \[p(a,b,c) \equiv a + b + c\ .\] The mathematical expression
of the relationship between area \(A\) enclosed by the triangle and the
side lengths goes back at least 2000 years to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria}{Heron of
Alexandria} (circa 10--70). As a function, it can be written
\[A(a,b,c) \equiv \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\strut 4a^2b^2-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2}\ .\]

We can't readily plot out this function because there are three inputs
and one output, and it's unnatural to draw a 4-dimensional space. But we
can draw a \textbf{slice} through the 4-dimensional space.

Let's do that by setting, say, \(a=1\) and looking at the area as a
function of the lengths of sides \(b\) and \(c\).

Another slice might set \(a = b\), in which case we would be showing the
areas of isosceles triangles.

In this exercise, you'll be modifying the sandbox code to draw different
functions, so you can examine their shapes.

Your task is to read and interpret the graphs of the basic modeling
functions. Here, you will be looking for \textbf{\emph{zero-crossings}}:
the neighborhood of a point in the function's domain where the
\textbf{output} of the function is negative for inputs on one side and
positive for inputs on the other side. If zero is touched but not
crossed, we'll call that ``touched zero.''

Make a list of the pattern-book functions. For each function in the
list, say whether the function crosses zero, touches zero but doesn't
cross, or doesn't touch at all in the part of the domain shown in the
graphic: \(-3 \leq x \leq 3\). Also note if the value of the function
appears to be reaching a horizontal asymptote at zero for very negative
\(x\), for very positive \(x\), for both, or neither.

We'll show you the answers for the exponential function. You'll have to
modify the computer command to graph the other pattern-book functions.

Some of our pattern-book functions have a distinctive property called
\textbf{scale invariance}. This means the graph of the function looks
the same even when plotted on very different horizontal and vertical
axes. The function \(\ln(x)\) plotted on two different scales in Figure
@ref(fig:log-scale-invariance) shows that the graph of the function has
practically the same shape.

\(g(x) \equiv x^2\), which is also scale invariant.

Other pattern-book functions are not scale invariant, for example
\(\sin(x)\).

}

\caption{\label{fig-sin-invariance-2}The sin( ) function is not scale
invariant.}

\end{figure}

In contrast to scale-invariant functions, some of our pattern-book
functions have a \textbf{\emph{characteristic scale}}. This is a domain
length over which the whole of a characteristic feature of the function
is evident. Graphing on larger domains simply squashes down the
characteristic feature to a small part of the graphic domain. For
instance, in the \(\sin()\) function the cycle is a characteristic
feature. The cycle in the pattern-book sinusoid has a characteristic
length of \(2 \pi\), the length of the cycle. Consequently, the graph
looks different depending on the length of the graphics domain in
multiples of the characteristic length. You can see from Figure
@ref(fig:sin-invariance) that the graph on the domain \(-10 < x < 10\),
that is, about 3 times the characteristic scale, looks different from
the graph on the larger domain that has a length 30 times the
characteristic scale.

The output of the sigmoid function runs from 0 to 1 but reaches these
values only asymptotically, as \(x \rightarrow \pm \infty\). In defining
a characteristic scale, it would be reasonable to look at the length of
the domain that takes the output from, say, 0.01 to 0.99. In other
words, we want the characteristic scale to be defined in a way that
captures \textbf{almost} all the action in the output of the function.
For a gaussian, a reasonable definition of a characteristic scale would
be the length of domain where the output falls to about, say, 1\% of
it's peak output.

\textbf{Question A} The gaussian (hump) function \texttt{dnorm()} has a
characteristic scale. Which of these is a domain length that can
encompass the characteristic shape of the gaussian?

~~~~{0.1{x}}~~~~~~~{1{x}}~~~~~~~{6{\(\heartsuit\ \)The domain
\(-3 < x < 3\) supports practically everything.}}~~~~~~~{16{︎X
}}~~~~~~~{256{x}}

\textbf{Question B} The sigmoid function \texttt{pnorm()} also has a
characteristic scale. Which of these is a domain length that can
encompass the characteristic shape of the sigmoid?

~~~~{0.1{x}}~~~~~~~{1{x}}~~~~~~~{6{\(\heartsuit\ \)}}~~~~~~~{16{︎X
}}~~~~~~~{256{x}}

Throughout science, it's common to set a standard approach to defining a
characteristic scale. For instance, the characteristic scale of an
aircraft could be taken as the length of body. Gaussian and sigmoids are
so common throughout science that there is a convention for defining the
characteristic scale called the \textbf{\emph{standard deviation}}. For
the pattern book gaussian and sigmoid, the standard deviation is 1.
That's much shorter than the domain that captures the bulk of action of
the gaussian or sigmoid. For this reason, statisticians in practice use
a characteristic scale of \(\pm 2\) or \(\pm 3\) standard deviations.

Recall that each \textbf{\emph{basic modeling function}} is constructed
from the corresponding pattern-book function by scaling the input.

\[\text{pattern-book function}\ \ \underset{x\rightarrow a(x-x_0)}{\overset{\text{input scaling}}{\Large\Longrightarrow}} \ \ \text{basic modeling function}\]

Figure @ref(fig:fid-points) shows the pattern-book functions with some
added annotations. When the function has horizontal or vertical
asymptotes, the location is shown by orange arrows. There is also a blue
dot placed on the graph of functions with asymptotes. For functions
without asymptotes, there are two blue dots. The location of the
asymptotes and blue dots mark characteristic features of each function.
The positions of the blue dot and asymptotes, or the positions of the
two blue dots, are useful for figuring out the values of parameters in
basic modeling functions.

For example, the basic modeling reciprocal function is
\(g(x) \equiv \frac{1}{m (x-x_0)} + C\). The parameter \(C\) will be the
value where the horizontal asymptote crosses the vertical axis. The
parameter \(x_0\) will be the value where the vertical asymptote crosses
the horizontal axis. As for the parameter \(m\): find the input where
the function value is \(C+1\). Let's call that \(x^\star\). The
\(m = 1/(x^\star - x_0)\).

For the sinusoid, the blue dots mark the positive-going zero crossings
of the baseline. The horizontal distance between the blue dots is the
period parameter, \(P\). The horizontal position of either of the two
dots tells the phase offset \(x_0\).

\textbf{Exercise 8.7} ../Modeling/Exercises/walnut-run-dish.Rmd

Turn this into a guided problem to find the input and output scaling
that turns \(\sin()\) into the day-length versus day-of-year.

To illustrate, suppose that \(f(x)\) is one of the pattern-book
function, say, \(\sin()\). The input to pattern-book \(\sin()\) must
always be a pure number and the output will always be a pure number.
Consider a phenomenon that shows oscillatory behavior, for instance the
length of daylight (in hours) as a function of the day-of-the-year (1 to
365, in days). The output of the modeling function is a quantity in
hours, the input is a quantity in days. Neither this input nor the
output are pure numbers.

To use the pattern \(\sin()\) as a basis for modeling, we replace the
input name \(x\) with a straight-line function: \(x(t) = a t + b\). This
gives us the function \[\sin(a t + b)\] where \(a\) and \(b\) are
parameters. If \(t\) is to be the day-of-year in units of days, then the
parameter \(a\) will have units ``per day,'' so that \(a t\) will be a
pure number.

The output of the function \(\sin(a t + b)\) will be a pure number. In
order to translate this into a quantity such as length of daylight, we
apply another straight-line function, for instance
\[\text{daylight}(y) \equiv A y + B\] where \(y\) stands for the output
from \(\sin(a t + b)\) for any input \(t\). Putting this all together,
we have the function \[\text{daylight}(t) = A \sin(a t + b) + B\ ,\] a
function with four parameters: \(a\), \(b\), \(A\), and \(B\).

For example, for a location at latitude 40\(^\circ\)N, the length of
daylight is approximately
\[\text{daylight}_{40^\circ}(t) = 2.75 \sin(0.0173 t - 0.155) + 12\ ,\]
where \(t\) is in days (January 1 is \(t=1\) and December 31 is
\(t=365\)), 2.75 and 12 are in hours, 0.0173 is ``per day'' and 0.155 is
a pure number.

Keep in mind that the straight-line function is often written
\(\line(t) = a\left(t-t_0\right)\). In this form, the daylight()
function would be written
\[\text{daylight}_{40^\circ}(t) = 2.75 \sin(0.0173 \left(t - 9\right) + 12\ ,\]
where the 9 is in days.

Convert this to a guided exercise on finding the appropriate scale
conversion parameters.

Figure @ref(fig:covid-scale) shows the model we fit to the COVID-19 data
for the cumulative number of confirmed cases for each day in March:
\(\text{cases(day)} = e^{0.19(\text{day}- -32)}\)

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Preliminaries/exercise-layout_files/figure-pdf/fig-covid-scale-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-covid-scale}A graph of the pattern-book exponential
with an additional scale displayed (blue) to match it to the COVID-19
data}

\end{figure}

The function being drawn is simply \(e^x\): a function from the pattern
book. The black horizontal scale shows \(x\), the input to the
pattern-book function. Where does that value of \(x\) come from? It's
\(0.19(\text{day} - -32)\), where day is the number of the day in March.
For instance, on March 20, day\(=10\) and
\(0.19*(\text{day}- -32) = 9.88\). You can see that 20 on the blue scale
matches 10 on the black scale. The model says that on day 20 (blue
scale) the input to the pattern-book function will be 9.88 (black
scale). Plugging the input 9.88 into the pattern-book exponential gives
\(e^{9.88} = 19536 \approx 20,000\) cases.

The pattern-book function does not give a good model of the COVID case
numbers. But if we scale the input before applying the pattern-book
function, we are effectively laying a new axis, the blue one in Figure
@ref(fig:covid-scale), that is stretched and shifted from the
pattern-book input (blackscale). Using the blue axis lets us read off
the number of cases as a function of the day in March.

Input scaling empowers the pattern-book functions to model a huge
variety of phenomena. There's just one exponential function and it
always looks the same. But there is a huge variety of ways to draw a
blue axis, that is, to scale the input. With input scaling, the
pattern-book function is tailored to become one of our basic modeling
functions.

way is \(\text{rad2deg}(r) \equiv \frac{180}{\pi} r\).

In order to get the day-length formula to work in a computer, we can
compose the \(\tan()\) function with \texttt{deg2rad()}. The output of
\texttt{acos()} is in radians, so we have to convert it back to degrees.
Like this:

Now to make a plot of day length as a function of day of the year. Of
course, \texttt{day\_length(L,\ d)} does not take day of the year into
account. What's missing is to know the declination of the sun as a
function of calendar day.

The input is a number \(n\) that runs from 0 at the start of January 1st
to 365 at the end of December 31. In terms of this input, the
declination of the sun is known to be approximately ::: \{.cell\}

Make this about identifying the functions being composed, multiplied, or
linearly combined.

\textbf{All together now!}

Two or all three of the techniques for combining functions---linear
combinations, function composition, and function multiplication---can be
used in the same function.

Consider the function for the length of the day
\[\text{daylight}(L, \delta) \equiv \frac{2}{15} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(\delta)\right)\]
The 2/15 is scaling the output of \(\arccos()\). The \(\arccos()\) is
being composed with an interior function that is itself a scaled product
of two functions.

\textbf{Exercise 9.3} ../Modeling/Exercises/pine-bring-dish.Rmd

Make this a computer exercise about multiplying functions. Try to play
the sounds they create.

This example concerns a bit of familiar technology: music synthesis.
Generating a pure tone electronically is easily done using a sinusoid.
Generating a note with rich instrumental timbre can be accomplished by a
linear combination of sinusoids. Of course, the note will be localized
in time. This could be accomplished by multiplying the sinusoids by a
gaussian function envelope.

It turns out that the gaussian function, \texttt{dnorm()}, does not
generate a realistic sound. Instead, a more complicated envelope is
used, such as the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)}{ADSR function}
shown in Figure @ref(fig:ADSR). The function has six (!) parameters: the
time the key is pressed, the duration A of the ``attack'' phase when the
sound amplitude is increasing in response to the impulse imposed on the
key, a decay of duration D to an output level S that lasts until the key
is released, then a decay to zero over duration R. It's reasonable to
think of the D and S phases as a piecewise linear approximation to
exponential decay.

Many printed tables are meant to be used as functions; you plug in the
input values and read off the output. Here's a table published by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index}{heat index}, a way of
summarizing the perceived comfort (or discomfort) of summer-like weather
conditions.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,height=\textheight]{Preliminaries/www/heat-index.png}

}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Question A} What are the inputs to the heat-index function

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {temperature and relative humidity{Nice!~}}\\
\item
  {temperature and wind speed{xThose are the inputs to the wind-chill
  function, not the heat index.}}\\
\item
  {temperature, latitude, and longitude{xThe heat index doesn't depend
  on location.}}
\end{enumerate}

The table shows three different functions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The heat index in \(^\circ\) F.
\item
  The heat index in \(^\circ\) C.
\item
  A caution warning level.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question B} For inputs of 70\% relative humidity and
\(88^{\circ}\) F, what are the outputs of the three functions?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {\(100^{\circ}\) F, \(38^\circ\) C, and ``extreme
  caution''.{Good.~}}\\
\item
  {\(100^\circ\) F, \(38^\circ\) C, and ``danger''.{xCheck again!}}\\
\item
  {\(100^\circ\) F, \(33^\circ\) C, and ``extreme caution''.{x33C does
  is not the same temperature as 100F.}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question C} Holding the relative humidity at 70\%, how much
would the ambient temperature have to increase (from \(88^\circ\) F) to
change the caution-level output to ``dangerous''?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {Increase by \(2^\circ\) F{Good.~}}\\
\item
  {Increase by \(6^\circ\) F{xIt looks like you're increasing the
  humidity to the point where the heat index is \(106^circ\) F. But we
  asked you how much the temperature \emph{input} has to change, not the
  heat-index output.}}\\
\item
  {Increase relative humidity to 80\%.{xIt's true that at
  \(100^\circ\) F and 80\% humidity, the caution-index is ``dangerous''.
  But the problem specified holding humidity constant.}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question D} From a starting point of \(88^\circ\) F and 70\%
humidity, what is the slope of the increase in heat index when moving to
80\% humidity.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {\(6^\circ\) F per 10 percentage points humidity{Nice!~}}\\
\item
  {\(6^\circ\) F{xA slope is always ``rise over run''. You've got the
  rise right, but what about the run?}}\\
\item
  {\(6^\circ\) F per 80\% humidity.{xThe slope is the change in output
  divided by the change in input, i.e.~``rise over run''. 80\% is the
  humidity at the endpoint, but the run is the change in humidity from
  the starting point to the endpoint.}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question E} What is the heat-index output when the inputs are
52\% relative humidity and \(91^\circ\) F? Choose the best answer.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {\(98.4^\circ\) F{Good.~Of course, the 4 in the last digit is sketchy,
  but it's reasonable to calculate the interpolated output by averaging
  over neighboring outputs.}}\\
\item
  {\(101^\circ\) F{xThat's the output at 55\% humidity and
  \(92^\circ\) F.}}\\
\item
  {The table doesn't say.{xWhile it's true that there is no table
  entry specifically for 52\% and \(91^\circ\) F, you can make a very
  reasonable guess by \emph{interpolation}, that is, reading between the
  rows and columns.}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question F} True or false: The caution-level output could have
been presented as a function of just one input, rather than needing both
temperature and humidity.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {TRUE{Good.~The caution-level output is not a function of ambient
  temperature alone or of humidity alone. But if you know the
  heat-index, you know that caution level exactly.}}\\
\item
  {FALSE{xNotice that the caution-level output is the same for any
  given level of the heat index, regardless of the ambient temperature
  or humidity separately.}}
\end{enumerate}

Income inequality is a matter of perennial political debate. In the US,
most people support Social Security, which is an income re-distribution
programming dating back almost a century. But other re-distribution
policies are controversial. Some believe they are essential to a healthy
society, others that the ``cure'' is worse than the ``disease.''

Imagine that society was divided statistically into income groups, from
poorest to richest. Each of these income groups consists of a fraction
of the population and has, in aggregate, a fraction of the national
income. Poor people tend to be many in number but to have a very small
fraction of income. Wealthy people are few in number, but have a large
fraction of income. The table shows data for US households in
2009:\sidenote{\footnotesize These data, as well as the general idea for the topic

up the population fraction in that row and previous rows. So, a

total income for the whole population.

Gaussian functions and sigmoidal functions come in pairs. For every
possible sigmoid, there is a corresponding gaussian that gives, for each
value of the input, the slope of the sigmoid.

Each of the following graphs shows a sigmoid and a gaussian function.
The two might or might not correspond to one another. That is, the
output of the gaussian might be the slope of the sigmoid, or the
gaussian might correspond to some other sigmoid. Remember, you're
comparing the \emph{output} of the gaussian to the \emph{slope} of the
sigmoid.

For each graph, say whether the gaussian and the sigmoid correspond to
one another. If not, choose one of the reasons why not.

In the plot, you'll see that the vertical axis has labels at 1, 10, 100,
1000, 10000. These numbers are hardly spaced evenly when plotted on a
linear scale, but on the log scale they are evenly spaced. Since there
is a factor of ten between consecutive labels, the interval between the
labels is called a \textbf{\emph{decade}}. On the horizontal axis, the
labels are at 10, 1000, 100,000, and 10,000,000. Each of those intervals
spans a factor of one hundred. For instance, from 1000 is one-hundred

Documentation is available via the link above.)

Perhaps the simplest display is to show the number of cumulative cases

Up through the beginning of March in the US, it is thought that most US
cases were in people travelling into the US from hot spots such as China
and Italy and the UK, as opposed to contagion between people within the
US. (Such contagion is called ``community spread.'') So let's look at
the data representing community spread, from the start of March onward.

Exponential growth appears as a straight-line on a semi-log plot.
Obviously, the overall pattern of the curves is not a straight line. The
explanation for this is that the exponential growth rate changes over
time, perhaps due to public health measures (like business closures,
mask mandates, etc.)

The first (official) US death from Covid-19 was recorded was recorded on
Feb.~29, 2020. Five more deaths occurred two days later, bringing the
cumulative number to 6.

\textbf{Question B} The tan data points for Feb 29/March 1 show up at
zero on the vertical scale for the semi-log plot. The tan data point for
March 2 is at around 2 on the vertical scale. Is this consistent with
the facts stated above?

\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {No.~The data contradict the facts.{xThink about what it means to be
  0 on the vertical scale.}}\\

\item
  {No.~The vertical scale doesn't mean anything.{xYou can see from the
  plotting command what the quantity on the vertical axis is:
  \texttt{log10(confirmed)} for the blue dots and \texttt{log10(deaths)}
  for the tan.}}
\end{enumerate}

One of the purposes of making a semi-log plot is to enable you to
compare very large numbers with very small numbers on the same graph.
For instance, in the semi-log plot, you can easily see when the first
death occurred, a fact that is invisible in the plot of the raw counts
(the first plot in this exercise).

Another feature of semi-log plots is that they preserve proportionality.
Look at the linear plot of raw counts and note that the curve for the
number of deaths is much shallower than the curve for the number of
(confirmed) cases. Yet on the semi-log plot, the two curves are
practically parallel.

On a semi-log plot, the arithmetic difference between the two curves
tells you what the proportion is between those curves. The parallel
curves mean that the proportion is practically constant. Calculate what
the proportion between deaths and cases was in the month of May. Here's
a mathematical hint:
\(\log_{10} \frac{a}{b} == \log_{10} a - \log_{10} b\). We are
interested in \(\frac{a}{b}\).

\textbf{Question C} What is the proportion of deaths to cases during the
month of May?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {about 1\%{xThis would correspond to a (vertical) difference between
  the curves of about 2 log10 units. Is it really that big?}}\\
\item
  {about 2\%{xThis would correspond to a (vertical) difference between
  the curves of about 1.7 log units. Is it really that big?}}\\
\item
  {about 5\%{Right!~On the semi-log plot, the deaths curve is about 1.2
  log10 units lower than the cases curve. \(10^{-1.2} = 0.063 = 6.3\%\))
  separates the two curves.}}\\
\item
  {about 25\%{xI'm not really sure what could lead you to this answer.
  You're making a mistake that I didn't anticipate.}}\\
\item
  {about 75\%{xIt's true that in May log10(deaths) is about 5, and
  log10(cases) is about 6, and 5/6 is indeed roughly 75\%. But, on a log
  scale, the proportion relates to the difference between logs, not the
  ratio of logs.}}
\end{enumerate}

In many applications, people use semi-log plots to see whether a pattern
is exponential or to compare very small and very large numbers. Often,
people find it easier if the vertical scale is written in the original
units rather than the log units. To accomplish both, the vertical scale
can be ruled with raw units spaced logarithmically, like this:

The \textbf{labels} on the vertical axis show the raw numbers, while the
\textbf{position} shows the logarithm of those numbers.

The next question has to do with the meaning of the interval between
grid lines on the vertical axis. Note that on the \emph{horizontal}
axis, the spacing between adjacent grid lines is half a month.

\textbf{Question D} What is the numerical spacing (in terms of raw
counts) between adjacent grid lines on the vertical axis? (Note: Two
numbers are different by a ``factor of 10'' when one number is 10 times
the other.'' Similarly, ``a factor of 100'' means that one number is 100
times the other.

\textbf{Exercise 14.6} ../Modeling/Exercises/lion-jump-kitchen.Rmd

Recall Robert Boyle's data on pressure and volume of a fixed mass of gas
held at constant pressure. In \textbf{?@sec-magnitude-graphics} of the
text you saw a graphical analysis that enabled you to identify Boyle's
Law with a power-law relationship between pressure and volume:
\[P(V) = a V^n\] On log-log axes, a power-law relationship shows up as a
straight-line graphically.

Taking logarithms translates the relationship to a straight-line
function:\[\text{lnP(lnV)} = \ln(a) + n\,  \ln(V)\] To find the
parameter \(n\), you can fit the model to the data. This R command will
do the job:

\begin{Shaded}

Open a SANDBOX and run the model-fitting command. Then, interpret the
parameters.

\textbf{Question A} What is the slope produced by \texttt{fitModel()}
when fitting a power law model?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {Roughly -1{xYou must be a very precise person!}}\\

\item
  {Slope \(> 0\){xYou should be able to see from the graph you made in
  part (1) that the slope is negative.}}
\end{enumerate}

According to the appropriate model that you found in (A) and (B),
interpret the function you found relating pressure and volume.

\textbf{Question B} As the volume becomes very large, what happens to
the pressure?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}

\item
  {Pressure becomes very small.{Good.~}}\\

\item
  {None of the above{x}}
\end{enumerate}

Return to your use of \texttt{fitModel()} to find the slope of the
straight-line fit to the appropriately log-transformed model. When you
carried out the log transformation, you used the so-called ``natural
logarithm'' with expressions like \texttt{log(pressure)}. Alternatively,
you could have used the log base-10 or the log base-2, with expressions
like \texttt{log(pressure,\ base\ =\ 10)} or
\texttt{log(volume,\ base\ =\ 2)}. Whichever you use, you should use the
same base for all the logarithmic transformations when finding the
straight-line parameters.

\textbf{Essay}: What's the obvious (simple) message of the above plot?

Now you are going to use semi-log and log-log scales to look at the

Fill in the \texttt{\_\_and\_so\_on\_\_} details correctly and run the

As written, both vertical and horizontal axes will be on log scales.
This may not be what you want in the end.

Arrange the plotting command to make a semi-log plot of mortality versus

labels such as those along the vertical axis are often called ``decade
labels.''

  {It increases exponentially.{Correct.~}}\\
\item
  {It increases, then decreases, then increases again.{xInteresting

Remake the plot of mortality vs age once again, but this time put it on
log-log axes. The sign of a power-law relationship is that it shows up
as a straight line on log-log axes.

\textbf{Exercise 15.4} ../Modeling/Exercises/crow-mean-dress.Rmd

The surface area \(S\) of a mammal is reasonably well approximated by
the function \[S(M) \equiv k M^{2/3}\] where \(M\) is the body mass (in
kg) and the constant \(k\) depends on the particular species under
consideration.

Note that \(M^{2/3}\) is \textbf{not an allowed arithmetic operation}.
\([M] = \text{mass}\), and mass, like any other dimension, cannot be
raised to a non-integer power. More properly, the expression should be
written \[\left(\frac{M}{1\  kg}\right)^{2/3}\] The division by ``1 kg''
renders dimensionless the quantity in the parentheses:
\[\left[\frac{M}{1\  kg}\right] = 1\] In order to render the quantity
both dimensionless and \emph{unitless}, \(M\) should be specified in kg.
The usual practice is to skip the ``1 kg'' business and simply say,
``Where \(M\) is in kg.'' You will see such notation frequently in your
career and should take care to use the indicated units.

You'll need to open a computing sandbox to do the calculations.

\textbf{Question A} Consider a baby and an adult. The adult's mass is
\(8\) times greater than the baby's. Then the adult's surface area is
\ldots?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}

\item

\item

  {8 times the baby's{x}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question B} Consider a human of body mass 70 kg with a skin
surface area of 18,600 cm\textsuperscript{2}. Which of the following
units for the constant of proportionality \(k\) is correct?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {cm\(^2\) kg\(^{-2/3}\){xKilograms to a fractional power is not a
  sensible unit.}}\\
\item
  {cm\(^2\){Nice!~}}\\
\item
  {cm\(^2\) kg\(^{2/3}\){xWhen you multiply \((70 kg/kg)^{2/3}\) by
  \(k\), you need to get a result in \(cm^2\).}}\\
\item
  {kg\(^{-1}\){xWould this produce \(cm^2\) for the result?}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question C} In the units of part (B), which value is \(k\)
closest to?

~~~~{1{x}}~~~~~~~{10{x}}~~~~~~~{100{︎X
}}~~~~~~~{1000{\(\heartsuit\ \)}}

The numerical value of the constant \(k\) changes depending on what
units you want to express it in. The value you found in part (C) works
for masses stated in kg and skin areas in cm\(^2\).

Suppose you want to figure out a value of \(k'\) that you can use in the
formula for people who are used to talking about skin area in square
inches and mass in pounds. The units of \(k\) are cm\(^2\), and we want
the units of \(k'\) to be in\(^2\). That part is easy: just multiply
\(k\) by two flavors of one to change the units from cm to inches, like
this:

\[k' = k\ \underbrace{\frac{\text{in}}{2.6 \text{cm}}}_\text{flavor of 1}\  \underbrace{\frac{\text{in}}{2.6 \text{cm}}}_\text{flavor of 1} = \frac{k}{2.6^2}\]
where the flavor of 1 reflects that 1 inch is 2.6 cm.

\textbf{But this is not the whole story}. We have to be very careful in
dealing with the \(\left(\frac{M}{1 kg}\right)^{2/3}\). Translated to
pounds, \(M = 70\ \text{kg} = 154\ \text{lbs}\), since, in the
rough-and-ready way everyday people express themselves, 1 kg \(\approx\)
2.2 lbs.\sidenote{\footnotesize Of course, pounds is a measure of force, not mass. But
  people use it as if it were mass. A mass of 70 kg corresponds to about
  4.8 slugs. In Earth's gravity, the mass 4.8 slugs produces a force of
  154 pounds.}

Plugging in \(M=154\) lbs makes the power-law part of the formula for
skin area \[\left(\frac{154\ \text{lbs}}{1\ \text{kg}}\right)^{2/3}\]
You can't take (pounds)\(^{2/3}\) or (kg)\(^{2/3}\); you won't get a
sensible unit in either case. But {[}pounds/kg{]} = {[}1{]}, so taking
the two-thirds power of the ratio is perfectly legitimate.

Still, there's a problem. Multiplying
\(k\ 154^{2/3} (\text{lbs}/\text{kg})^{2/3}\) has the right dimension,
but strange-looking units that have nothing to do with skin area.

The resolution to this paradox is to multiply
\(\frac{154\ \text{lbs}}{1\  \text{kg}}\) by an appropriate flavor of 1
to render the dimensionless quantity unitless as well as dimensionless.
This flavor will be \(\frac{1 \text{kg}}{2.2 lbs}\), giving a formula
for skin area in square inches:

\(k = 1000 \text{cm}^2\) when specifying mass in kilograms, what should
be the numerical value of \(k'\) in square-inches that should be used
when body mass is given in pounds?

\textbf{Exercise 15.5} ../Modeling/Exercises/Boyd-1.Rmd

The ``Energy-maneuverability Theory'' (E-M) of aircraft performance was
developed by renowned fighter pilot Col John Boyd and mathematician
Thomas Christie in the 1960s. The theory posits that the available
maneuverability of an aircraft is closely related to its \emph{specific
energy} \(E_s\), that is, the kinetic plus potential energy of the
aircraft divided by aircraft weight. To be highly maneuverable, an
aircraft must be able to change it's specific energy rapidly in time.
Let's call this ability the \emph{specific power} (that is, power
divided by mass), \(P_s\). An aircraft with large \(P_s\) is more
maneuverable than one with small \(P_s\).

An important formula in E-M Theory is \[P_s = \frac{T - D}{W} V\] where
\(T\) is aircraft thrust, \(D\) is drag, \(W\) is weight, and \(V\) is
velocity. \((T-D)\), thrust minus drag, is the net forward force on the
aircraft.

Recall these facts about the dimension of physical quantities:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Velocity has dimension \(L^1 T^{-1}\) (e.g.~meters per second)
\item
  Acceleration has dimension \(L^1 T^{-2} =\) {[}Velocity{]}
  \(\times\  T^{-1}\) (e.g.~meters per second-squared)
\item
  Force has dimension \(M \times\ \) {[}Acceleration{]}
\item
  Energy has dimension {[}Force{]} \(\times\  L\)
\item
  Power has dimension {[}Energy{]} \(\times\  T^{-1}\).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question A} Which of the following is a correct dimensional
formulation of power?

~~~~{{[}Force{]}{[}Velocity{]}{\(\heartsuit\ \)}}~~~~~~~{{[}Energy{]}{[}Velocity{]}{︎X

Newton's law of universal gravitation---also known as the inverse square
law---is generally written \[F = G \frac{m_1\ m_2}{r^2} .\] \(m_1\) and
\(m_2\) are the masses of the two objects (say, Earth and Sun). \(r\) is
the distance between the two objects (about 150,000,000 km). \(F\) is
the gravitational force and \(G\) is a fixed quantity called the
``gravitational constant.''

Of course, you already know the dimension of force, mass, and distance.

In this book, we are parameterizing the sinusoid using the
\textbf{\emph{period}} \(P\), the duration a cycle. In many settings,
such as communications engineering and physics, it is preferable to
parameterize in terms of the \textbf{\emph{frequency}}, often written
with the Greek letter \(\omega\) (``omega'').

Here's the relationship:
\[\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P} t\right) = \sin(2\pi \omega t)\]

\textbf{Question A} When the input quantity \(t\) represents time, it
has dimension T. The period P has the same dimension so that the overall
argument to \(\sin()\) is dimensionless, as required. What is the
dimension of \(\omega\)?

In an earlier exercise, we looked at human breathing. The period of a

../Differentiation/Exercises/snail-tear-blanket.Rmd

We will be working extensively with the \emph{change} in output value of
a function when the \emph{input value changes}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The change in the output value of a function \(f()\) when the input
  changes from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\) is \[f(x=b) - f(x=a)\] Notice that
  when we talk about the change from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\) we subtract
  \(f(a)\) from \(f(b)\). That change is sometimes called the
  \textbf{rise} in the value of the function. Rise always compares (by
  subtraction) the two \textbf{output values} corresponding to two
  specific input values. Remember that \(a\) and \(b\) stand for
  specific numbers.
\item
  Corresponding with the idea of the change in output being
  \(f(b) - f(a)\) the change in the input value to a function is
  \(b - a\). This is often called the \emph{run} in the value of the
  input.

The next sandbox contains an example asking you to compute the average
rate of change of \(f(x) \equiv e^x\) over the interval {[}0, 4{]}. You
only need lines 1, 3, and 5. The other lines show intermediate results

\textbf{Exercise 17.9} ../Differentiation/Exercises/exponentials.Rmd

In this question, we ask you to estimate the slope from a graph of the
function. But the function is \textbf{exponential}, so not a straight
line.

A fundamental idea in calculus is that even a function with a curved
graph, if you zoom in closely around a given point, will look like a
straight line. And you know how to calculate the slope of a straight
line.

When the graph is curved, the slope will be different at different
points along the graph. So there's not a single slope for the function.
Still, we can talk about the ``slope at a point.''

One way to specify a point on a function's graph is to give the
horizontal coordinate: the \textbf{input} to the function. But here
we're going to give you the \textbf{output} of the function. So long as
the function passes the \textbf{\emph{horizontal-line test}}, as the
exponential does, specifying any particular output in the function's
range \emph{uniquely} identifies a corresponding input.

Estimate the slope of the exponential function \(g(x) \equiv e^x\) at
several inputs, which we'll call \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\) and \(x_4\).
We won't give you numerical values for the \(x_i\) points, but we will
tell you the output of the function at each of those inputs. the values
of \(x\) where:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(g(x_1) = 1\)
\item
  \(g(x_2) = 5\)
\item
  \(g(x_3) = 10\)
\item
  \(g(x_4) = 0.1\)
\end{enumerate}

For each of (a)-(d), use a sandbox to plot the exponential function
\(e^x\) on a domain zoomed in around around the appropriate value of
\(x_i\). Then calculate the slope of the curve at that \(x_i\).

\textbf{Question A} Using your answers for the slope at the points given
in (a)-(d), choose the best answer to this question: What is the pattern
in the slope as \(x\) varies?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {The slope at each value \(x_i\) is the same as
  \(e^{x_i}\).{Good.~This property of the exponential function becomes
  important when describing a wide range of phenomena, from nuclear
  isotope decay to population growth.}}\\
\item
  {The slope at each value \(x_i\) is the same as \(x_i\).{xThat would
  being saying the slope at \(x_3\) is \(\approx 2.30\). Is that what
  you got?}}\\
\item
  {The slope at each value of \(x_i\) is the same as \(x_i^2\).{xThat
  would being saying the slope at the \(x_3\) is \(\approx 5.30\). Is
  that what you got?}}\\
\item
  {The slope at each value of \(x\) is the same as \(\sqrt{x}.\){xThat
  would being saying the slope at the \(x_i\) is \(\approx 1.52\). Is

For each exercise, you are given a series of intervals that get smaller
and smaller. Your job is to calculate the \emph{average rate of change}
of the function \(f(x) \equiv x^2\) for each of the intervals. As the
width of the intervals approach zero, our \emph{average} rates of change
become better approximations of the \emph{instantaneous} rate of change.
You should use the results you calculate to make an informed
\emph{estimate} of the \textbf{instantaneous rate of change}.

\textbf{Exercise 17.13} ../Differentiation/Exercises/lamb-put-bulb.Rmd

Sometimes a bit of algebra can help us see what's going on with the
instantaneous rate of change. Consider the exponential function \(e^x\).

Rather than writing the slope function definition with a 0.1, let's
substitute in the symbol \(h\). This gives
\[{\cal D}\exp(x) = \frac{e^{x+h} - e^x}{h}\] Extracting out the common
term \(e^x\) in the numerator, we arrive at
\[{\cal D}\exp(x) = e^x \left[\frac{e^h - 1}{h}\right]\] Since \(h\) is
a number, \([e^h - 1]/h\) is a number, not a function of \(x\). So, for
any given value of \(h\), the slope function of the exponential is
proportional to the exponential itself.

\textbf{Question A} Using a sandbox, find the value of \([e^h - 1]/h\)
when \(h=0.1\). Which of these is it?

~~~~{1.271828{x}}~~~~~~~{1.694343{︎X
}}~~~~~~~{1.718282{\(\heartsuit\ \)}}~~~~~~~{e = 2.718282{x}}

The instantaneous rate of change involves making \(h\) very small, but
not quite zero. If you make \(h\) exactly zero, the result will be
ambiguous.

\textbf{Question B} Using a sandbox, compute \([e^0 - 1]/0\). What's the
result?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}

\item
  {\texttt{Inf}{xThis would be the result if the numerator were
  positive, however small. But both the numerator and the denominator
  are zero.}}\\

  used in arithmetic.}}\\
\item
  {An error message result.{xThe point of \texttt{Inf} and
  \texttt{NaN} is to avoid creating error conditions while still

In the following, three different functions are described. Your task is
to write down the \textbf{dimension} of the input and of the output. Do
this both for the function itself, and for the derivative of the
function. For example, the dimension of the output of \(N(y)\) given
below is P, for population. The input has dimension T, for time.

\textbf{Exercise 18.16} ../Differentiation/Exercises/SIR-dimensions.Rmd

The standard model of epidemics used in public health planning is called
the \textbf{\emph{SIR model}}. (SIR stands for ``Susceptible (S),
Infective (I), Recovered (R)'', the sequence that a person starts in,
moves to, and ends up in (hopefully!) in an epidemic.)

One of the equations in the SIR model is \[\frac{dS}{dt} = -a S I\]

The notation \(dS/dt\) means ``the rate of change of number of
susceptibles, S, with respect to time.'' This has dimension
``people/T''. The dimensions \([S]\) and \([I]\) are each simply
``people.''

\textbf{Question A} What is \([a]\)?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {T{x}}\\
\item
  {T\(^{-1}\){x}}\\
\item
  {people/T{xThen \([a S I]\) would be people\(^3\)/T, but that's not
  the same as \([dS/dt]\).}}\\
\item
  {people\(^{-1}\) T\(^{-1}\){Correct.~This correctly gives \([a S I]\)
  as people/T, which is the same as \([dS/dt]\).}}\\
\item
  {people \(\times\) T{x}}\\
\item
  {None of the above.{x}}
\end{enumerate}

Another equation in the SIR model describes how the number of infective
people changes over time:

\[\frac{dI}{dt}  = - a S I - b I\] where \([\frac{dI}{dt}] =\) people/T.

\textbf{Question B} What is \([b]\)?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {T{x}}\\
\item
  {T\(^{-1}\){Right!~}}\\
\item
  {people/T{xThen \([a S I]\) would be people\(^3\)/T, but that's not
  the same as \([dS/dt]\).}}\\
\item
  {people\(^{-1}\) T\(^{-1}\){xIf this were true, \([bI]\) would be
  T\(^{-1}\). But \([bI]\) has to be the same as \([dI/dt]\), which is
  people \(T^{-1}\).}}\\

As you know, given a function \(g(x)\) it's easy to construct a new
function \({\cal D}_x g(x)\) that will be an approximation to the
derivative \(\partial_x g(x)\). The approximation function, which we
call the slope function, can be
\[{\cal D}_x g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x + 0.1) - g(x)}{0.1}\]

Open a SANDBOX and use \texttt{makeFun()} to create a function
\(g(x) \equiv \sin(x)\) and another that will be the slope function,
called it \texttt{slope\_of\_g()}.

All three of these pattern-book functions are members of the power-law

There is a differentiation rule for the power-law family generally. The

functions in the table above and seeing which formula gives the correct
answer for the derivative.

\texttt{D()} which calculates the derivative, sometimes using symbolic
methods and sometimes using a finite-difference method.

As an example of the use of \texttt{D()}, here is some more R code that
defines a function \texttt{f()} and finds \(\partial_x f()\), calling it
\texttt{d\_f()}. Then a slice plot is made of both \texttt{f()} and

:::

For each of the following functions, write a brief comparison of the
function to it's differenced version. You can combine phrases such as
``same shape'', ``different shape. larger in amplitude'', ``smaller in
amplitude'', ``same period'', ``shorter period'', ``longer period'', or
whatever seems appropriate. For instance, for the original example in
the sandbox, a reasonable comparison might be, ``f() is concave down but
Diff(f) is concave up.''

A. For the function \(f(x) \equiv 3 x\), compare \(f()\) to
\(\partial_x f\).

B. For the function \(f(x) \equiv x^2\), compare \(f()\) to
\(\partial_x f\).

C. For the function \(f(x) \equiv e^x\), compare \(f()\) to

In a sandbox, create this function and plot it. (Note: \texttt{rfun()}
generates random functions in the same way you might by moving a pencil
smoothly on a piece of paper. The \texttt{seed\ =\ 8427} effectively
chooses which one of infinitely many functions is being generated.
Different seeds give different functions. )

You can see that in the region near \(x = -1\) the function is concave
down. While near \(x=2.5\) the function is concave up.

In your sandbox, compute the \textbf{\emph{second derivative}} of
\(f(x)\) and evaluate it at \(x=-1\) and \(x=2.5\).

Using these results, and perhaps experimenting a little with different
values of \(x\), you should be able to answer this question:

\textbf{Question A} Which of these is a correct statement of ``concave
up'' in terms of the value of \(\partial_{xx} f(x)\)?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {A function is concave-up at input \(x_0\) when
  \(\partial_{xx} f(x_0) > 0\){Nice!~}}\\

  {A function is concave-up at input \(x_0\) when
  \(\partial_{xx} f(x_0) < 0\){x}}\\
\item
  {A function is concave-up at input \(x_0\) when
  \(\partial_{xx} f(x_0) < 0\) \textbf{and} \(\partial_x f(x_0) < 0\){︎X
  The first derivative has nothing to do with it.}}\\
\item

  \(\partial_{xx} f(x_0) > 0\) \textbf{and} \(\partial_x f(x_0) > 0\){︎X

\end{enumerate}

Recall that an \textbf{\emph{inflection point}} is a value for the input
\(x\) at which \(f(x)\) changes from concave up to concave down, or
\emph{vice versa}. Add a statement to your sandbox to graph
\(\partial_{xx} f(x)\).

\textbf{Question B} From reading the graph of \(\partial_{xx} f(x)\),
say which of these is nearest to an inflection point for \(f(x)\).

Intuition suggests that the radius of an enscribed circle for \(g()\)
should match the radius of the graph of the function.

In a SANDBOX, create a function to calculate the curvature of \(g()\) at
any input \(x\). Then plot that curvature function over the domain
\(-2 < x < 2\). Is the curvature of \(g()\) indeed constant? To help you
