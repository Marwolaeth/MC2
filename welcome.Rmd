## Welcome to calculus {.unnumbered}

Calculus is the set of concepts and techniques that form the mathematical basis for dealing with motion, growth, decay, and oscillation.  The phenomena can be as simple as a ball arcing ballistically through the air or as complex as turbulent airflow over a wing generating lift. Calculus is used in biology and business, chemistry, physics and engineering. It is the foundation for weather prediction and understanding climate change. It is the basis for the algorithms for heart rate and blood oxygen measurement by wristwatches. It is a key part of the language of science. The electron orbitals of chemistry, the stresses of bones and beams, and the business cycle of recession and rebound are all understood primarily through calculus. 

Calculus has been central to science from the very beginnings. It is no coincidence that the scientific method was introduced and the language of calculus was invented by the same small group of people during the historical period known as the [***Enlightenment***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) in the late 17th century. Learning calculus has always been a badge of honor and an entry ticket to professions. Millions of students' career ambitions have been enhanced by passing a calculus course or thwarted by lack of access to one.

In the 1880s, a hit musical featured "the very model of a modern major general."  One of his claims for modernity: "I'm very good at integral and differential calculus."

What was modern in 1880 is not modern anymore. Yet, amazingly, calculus today is every bit as central to science and technology as it ever. Indeed, calculus remains central to fields that were not even imagined in 1880, such as logistics, economics, and data science. One reason is that science, engineering, and society have now fully adopted the computer for almost all aspects of work, study, and life. The collection and use of data is growing dramatically. Machine learning has become the way human decision makers interact with such data.

Think about what it means to become "computerized." To take an everyday example, consider video. Over the span of a human life, we moved from a system which involved people going to theaters to watch the shadows recorded on cellulose film to the distribution over the airwaves by low-resolution television, to the introduction of high-def broadcast video, to on demand streaming from huge libraries of movies. Just about anyone can record, edit, and distribute their own video. The range of topics (including calculus) on which you can access a video tutorial or demonstration is incredibly vast. All of this recent progress is owed to computers. 

The "stuff" on which computers operate, transform, and transmit is always mathematical representations stored as bits. The creation of mathematical representations of objects and events in the real world is essential to every task of any sort that any computer performs. Calculus is a key component of inventing and using such representations.

You may be scratching your head. If calculus is so important, why is it that many of your friends who took calculus came away wondering what it is for? What's so important about "slopes" and "areas" and how come your high-school teacher might have had trouble telling you what calculus is for?

The disconnect between the enthusiasm expressed in the preceding paragraphs and the lived experience of students is very real. There are two major reasons for that disconnect, both of which we tackle head-on in this book.

First, teachers of mathematics have a deep respect for tradition. Such respect has its merits, but the result is that almost all calculus is taught using methods that were appropriate for the era of paper and pencil---not for the computer era. As you will see, in this book we express the concepts of calculus in a way that carries directly over to the uses of calculus on computers and in genuine work. 

Second, the uses of calculus are enabled not by the topics of Calc I and Calc II alone, but the courses for which Calc I/II are preliminary: linear algebra and dynamics. Only a small fraction of students who start in Calc I ever reach the parts of calculus that are the most useful. Fortunately, there is a large amount of bloat and rote in the standard textbook topics of Calc I/II. This can be removed to make room for the more important topics, as we try to do in this book.

You will want to use a computer to follow this book. Your instructor might want you to set up the required software in a way that fits the resources and course-support systems of your institution. Alternatively, you can set up what you need for free on a standard laptop computer or even use a tablet with a keyboard. Instructions for this are given in Appendix @sec-software-installation.

The computer language used in this book is R. This is a mainstream language in high demand by employers in many field. The small amount of R that you need to learn for this book will open doors to much greater possibilities. We have augmented R with a widely used package, `{mosaic}`, that simplifies access to calculus-related operations. 

## Instructor's preface

The "MOSAIC" in the book's title refers to a movement in undergraduate mathematics to integrate **M**odeling, **S**tatistics and data science, *C*omputing, and *C*alculus. Skill in all these areas is needed for successful work in the technical and scientific world. Traditionally, teaching does not honor the strong links among these areas and ignores the advantages of teaching them in a unified way. Indeed, modeling, though often mentioned in calculus textbook blurbs, is hardly taught at all. Introductory statistics courses, even those with a formal pre-requisite of calculus, do not draw on calculus concepts beyond the mention of "area under a curve." Few and far between are introductory computing courses that reinforce calculus and statistics topics, or calculus courses that develop and build on computing and data skills.

The isolation of mathematical calculus from disciplines that ought to be considered allies leads to a devastating gap in the education of students. The half-life of a student in a calculus sequence is, roughly speaking, one course. (The decay in participation starts in algebra and trigonometry.) The result is that only a small fraction of students see relevant mathematics of multiple variables and hardly any encounter the powerful concepts of spaces, vectors, and matrix factorizations traditionally reserved for a junior-year linear algebra course. Contemporary statistical modeling techniques, including machine learning, draw heavily on a small core of linear-algebra topics.

The design of the mosaic serves the goal of providing for all students access to a broad, directly useful education in the mathematical sciences. One component of access is keeping the program small enough to fit in with a plausible student schedule. Our working definition of "small enough" is one-quarter of the first two years of university. Fitting within this envelope, students ought to achieve basic competence in computing, statistics, and calculus.

Calculus provides opportunities to prepare students well for both modern statistics and computing. The most direct ties to statistics are modeling, functions of multiple variables, and concepts of linear spaces. The relevant links of calculus to computing are extensive and go both ways. To give but one example: It's impractical for students to construct contour plots without a computer. With a computer at hand, students can learn about mathematical ideas such as gradients and iterative optimization. For instance, constrained optimization is hardly a topic of standard introductory calculus and Lagrange multipliers are mysterious even to many professors. The essential concepts become much clearer when they can be presented using graphical tools of contours and gradient fields.
